A compelling vision creates a clear picture of the future. It is critical that your life vision aligns with what you are doing each day. This alignment ensures a powerful emotional connection that helps you overcome challenges and promotes a sustained commitment, and continual action.

There are three time horizons that you'll want to focus your vision on:
1. Long-term aspirations
2. Mid-term goals, about three years into the future
3. 12 weeks

## Long-Term Vision
- Think of all the things that you want to have, to do, and to be in your life. Think of what is most important to you
	- Physically
	- Spiritually
	- Mentally
	- Relationally
	- Financially
	- Professionally
	- Personally
- How much time freedom do you want? What income do you desire?
- Construct this Long-Term vision for your life 5, 10, 15 years into the future. There are no right or wrong answers.

- Financially - I am financially independent allowing me the freedom to live life on my terms. I am able to support and spoil loved ones.

## Three-Year Vision
