## Ingredients
- [ ] 10 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- [ ] 7 tablespoons olive oil
- [ ] 7 garlic cloves, minced
- [ ] 3 lemon (juice and zest)
- [ ] 2 teaspoon dried oregano

- [ ] Asparagus
- [ ] 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- [ ] 1 orange bell pepper, sliced
- [ ] 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
- [ ] 4 zucchini, sliced

## Instructions
- [ ] **Marinate the chicken**:
    - [ ] In a small bowl, mix the olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, oregano, salt, and pepper.
    - [ ] Place the chicken breasts in a resealable bag or container, pour the marinade over the chicken, and let it marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours for more flavor).

    - [ ] Spread the vegetables on a baking sheet.
- [ ] **Cook the chicken**

	- [ ] Remove the chicken and set aside.
- [ ] **Roast the vegetables**:
	- [ ] While the chicken is cooking, place the sheet with the vegetables in the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, stirring halfway, until tender and slightly caramelized.
- [ ] **Serve**:
	- [ ] Slice the chicken breasts and serve alongside the roasted vegetables. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.
