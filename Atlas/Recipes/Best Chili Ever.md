## Directions
- [x] Prepare the Beans
	- [x] Place into large container or bowl. 
		- [x] Dry Beans, 2 pounds
		- [x] Kosher Salt, 108 grams or 12 tablespoons
		- [x] Water, 8 quarts
	- [x] Allow to soak at room temperature at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. 
	- [x] Drain and rinse the soaked beans
- [ ] Prepare the Chiles
	- [ ] Add dried chiles to a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stockpot
	- [ ] Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with an intense, roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. 
		- [ ] Do not allow to smoke. 
	- [ ] Remove chiles, place in a small bowl, and set aside.
	- [ ] Reduce the heat to medium and add to the Dutch oven or stockpot:
		- [ ] Cumin
		- [ ] Coriander
		- [ ] Cloves
		- [ ] Star anise
	- [ ] Stir, toasting until the spices become fragrant. 
	- [ ] Remove spices, cool slightly, then transfer to a spice grinder and grind into a powder. Set aside.
- [ ] Prepare Short Ribs
	- [x] Season short ribs on all sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper. 
	- [x] Add oil to Dutch oven and heat over high heat until smoking. 
	- [x] Add half of short ribs and brown well on all sides (it may be necessary to brown ribs in 3 batches, depending on size of Dutch oven—do not overcrowd pan), 8 to 12 minutes total, reducing heat if fat begins to smoke excessively or meat begins to burn. 
	- [x] Transfer to a large rimmed baking sheet or plate. 
	- [x] Repeat with remaining short ribs, browning them in the fat remaining in Dutch oven. 
	- [x] Once all short ribs are cooked, transfer all rendered fat into a small bowl and reserve separately. 
	- [x] Allow short ribs to cool at room temperature.
- [ ] Make chile purée
	- [ ] Return Dutch oven to medium-high heat
	- [ ] Add 1 cup (240ml) chicken broth
	- [ ] Scrape browned bits off of bottom of pan 
	- [ ] Reduce heat until chicken broth is at a bare simmer
	- [ ] Add toasted chiles to liquid
	- [ ] Cook until chiles have softened and liquid is reduced by half, 5 to 8 minutes. 
	- [ ] Transfer chiles and liquid to a blender. 
	- [ ] Add to blender:
		- [ ] Ground spices
		- [ ] Chocolate
		- [ ] Tomato paste
		- [ ] Coffee
		- [ ] Anchovies
		- [ ] Soy sauce
		- [ ] Marmite
	- [ ] Blend at high speed, scraping down sides as necessary, until a completely smooth purée has formed, about 2 minutes. 
	- [ ] Set chile purée aside.
- [ ] Trim meat from short rib
	- [ ] Hand-chop into rough 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch pieces (finer or larger, as you prefer), reserving bones separately. 
	- [ ] Add any accumulated meat juices to chile purée.
- [ ] Assemble, cook, and serve
	- [ ] Heat 4 tablespoons (60ml) rendered beef fat (if necessary, add vegetable oil to reach 4 tablespoons) in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed stockpot over medium heat until shimmering.
	- [ ] Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
	- [ ] Add garlic, fresh chiles, and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. 
	- [ ] Add chile purée and cook, stirring frequently and scraping bottom of pot, until chile mixture begins to fry and leaves a coating on bottom of pan, 2 to 4 minutes.
	- [ ] Add remaining chicken stock, chopped beef, beef bones, and bay leaves.
	- [ ] Bring to a simmer, scraping bottom of pan to loosen browned bits.
	- [ ] Reduce heat to lowest possible setting, add beans, and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans are almost tender, about 1 hour.
	- [ ] Add crushed tomatoes and cider vinegar and cook, with cover slightly ajar, until beans and beef are fully tender and broth is rich and lightly thickened, 2 to 3 1/2 hours longer, adding water if necessary to keep beans and meat mostly submerged (a little protrusion is okay).
	- [ ] Using tongs, remove and discard bay leaves and bones.
	- [ ] At this point, any excess meat still attached to the bones can be removed, chopped, and added back to the chili, if desired.
	- [ ] Add bourbon, brown sugar, and hot sauce and stir to combine. 
	- [ ] Season to taste with kosher salt, ground black pepper, and additional vinegar.
	- [ ] Serve immediately, or, for best flavor, allow to cool and refrigerate overnight, or up to 1 week in a sealed container. 
	- [ ] Reheat and serve with desired garnishes.
