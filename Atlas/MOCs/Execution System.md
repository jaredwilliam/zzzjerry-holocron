1. [[Accountability]]
2. [[Commitment]]
3. [[Greatness in the Moment]]

## Disciplines
It is important that you see the interconnectedness of these disciplines. If you don't have a compelling vision, then the others don't matter because you are not living a life by design but by chance. If you have a vision but no plan, then you have a pipe dream. If you have a vision and a focused plan but lack process control, then you'll have a lot of frustration, because some days you will execute and make progress and some days you won't. If you have those but lack the courage to keep score, then there is no way for you to know what is working and what isn't. There is no way for you to make any adjustments that can accelerate your success. Finally, if you have all of those but not intentional about what you say yes to and what you say no to, then the day is controlling you.
