[[Zettelkasten Workflow Diagram.canvas|Zettelkasten Workflow Diagram]]

## Introduction
A zettelkasten is an object. A zettelkasten is a method. A zettelkasten is organized bottom-up. A zettelkasten is a form of controlled chaos. A zettelkasten is a practice. 

Zettelkasten method: 
1. Capture ideas in the form of fleeting and/or reference notes. 
2. Turn these captures into individual main notes. 
3. Establish connections between the ideas recorded in these main notes. 
4. Keep track of developing trains of thought in hub notes, structure notes, and indexes.
5. Turn these trains of thought into writing. 

##  Capturing Your Thoughts
### Getting Thoughts Out of Your Head
Humans excel at generating insights, our capacity to retain them is limited

### What Are Fleeting Notes?
Fleeting notes are a way to remember things. 

Fleeting notes are reminders of information… for capturing ideas as quickly while you are busy doing something else. 

### How to Take Fleeting Notes
Writing a note down is where most people stop the process. With Zettelkasten, know that the note you just took has yet to realize its potential. 

1. Have a thought.
2. Write it down. 
3. Know that you'll need to transform this note into something else, if it is to become useful. 

### Stage Your Fleeting Notes in an Inbox
Have dedicated spots to take fleeting notes. This could be multiple spots. 

If your zettelkasten is filed with every random thought you have, in whatever unedited state you capture it, your zettelkasten will zoon become an unpleasant place to visit. 

Process the contents of your inbox at least once a week. 

### Take Advantage of a "Sleeping" Folder
Any notes that seem hard to process, but are still relevant to your thinking, should be moved to a "Sleeping" folder. 

Check on the sleeping notes every few months. 

### The Difference Between Fleeting Notes and Main Notes
If the ideas captured in fleeting notes are to connect with others inside your slip box, they'll need to be rewritten in the form of main notes. 

### Not All Fleeting Notes Go to Heaven
Since fleeting notes can be comprised of any thought you have at any given time, and since not every thought you have will be relevant to your interests and writing, not all fleeting notes will become main notes. 

### Why Take Notes?
Note-taking allows you to quickly get ideas out of your head and onto the page, forcing previously amorphous thoughts to engage with the language needed to convert them into coherent ideas. 

Struggling to put an idea into words forces us to wrestle with the language through which that idea will be expressed. Rather than being a means of recording what we already believe, writing, even in the form of short notes, helps us understand what we think we know. 

When you write down an idea with the intent of publishing / sharing it, you tend to write it with a lot more intentionality and thought. 

### Welcome to the Path
Note-taking is writing, and writing is a path toward knowing. 

## Taking Notes While Reading
### What Is a Reference Note?
A reference note is a single long-note containing brief citations or "references" to what caught your attention while reading a book, listening to a podcast, watching a video, or having a conversation. 

### Differences Between References Notes and Fleeting Notes
A fleeting note is taken when you think of or want to remember something on the go. 

References notes are taken while you're actively engaging with media, capturing ideas and passages as you come across them. 

### How To Take Reference Notes
Capture them in such a way so that you can easily remember where you found the information and why you took note of it if needed. 

### Using a Personal Journal or Diary as a Source
The easiest way to turn your journals into sources is to add unique identifiers. 

### Six Things to Consider When Reading a Book
1. Read with a question of problem in mind.
2. Capture ideas you disagree with. 
3. Capture what you think about what the author thinks. 
	1. Reader-response theory posits that no one person, not even the author, has a monopoly on the meaning of text. Meaning is created through the act of reading. *Same with pieces of art.*
	2. Capture passages that inspire your own thoughts even if you don't fully understand those of the author. 
4. Capture someone else's interpretation.
5. Don't forget fiction.
   > Instead of seeing… novels as mere entertainment,… I see them as doing a certain kind of cultural work within a specific historical situation, and value them for that reason. I see their plots and characters as providing society with a means of thinking about itself… - Jane Tompkins
6. Go wild with your captures.

(page 31) The most important thing about any form of reference note-making is to, at some point, return to the note. It's the "going back" that makes all the difference, understanding that your initial scribble isn't the end of the capture. It's the beginning. A reference note is to be used *as a reference*. Its contents to be transformed into main notes. 

## Making Main Notes
### What's Inside a Main Note?
In its most basic form, a main note should have at least two components:
1. A single idea
2. A link to another idea stored in your zettelkasten

Other elements that add value are:
- a title
- a quote or reference to where the idea comes from
- a record pointing to where and how the idea has been used in your writing
- a unique ID

 The Single Idea - A main note works best when the thought contained inside has been pared down to its essentials. Having a single idea to contend with means you won't be sifting through counterarguments and varying points of view. Instead, you'll be dealing with a single unit of information that freely associates with others. 

Links - Links are used to establish relationships between ideas. By connecting thoughts, we give ourselves options, turning isolated, single-idea notes into long-form trains of thought. 

Titles - A title acts as a condensed thesis summing up the content of the idea stored in the note. It should be a declarative statement rather than a descriptor. "Not all apples are edible" is better than "Apples and edibility". The former tells the note maker what's being said inside the note while the latter hints at the topic to which the idea might be speaking. 

Quotes - Whenever you have an idea that's built off of, or speaks directly to what someone else has said, bring the quoted passage into your main note. 

A Record of Ideas You've Put to Use - One of the great benefits of creating dynamically linked, single-idea notes is that they can be reused. The more connections you make, and the more writing you create from these connections, the more important it'll be to track how and where an idea has been used in your writing. 

Alphanumeric IDs - Unique IDs give notes a permanent identity that can be referenced regardless of any changes made to the note's content. 

### Why Is There So Much Stuff In My Notes?
There is a lot going on inside of your main notes but it is all done in service of your future self. 

The "you" that's looking at your notes today isn't the same "you" that created them and will not be the same "you" five years from now looking to your notes for insight and guidance. 

### How to Create Main Notes
Processing your inbox and sleeping folder - Read the note to see if it contains something that might be useful for your thinking. If the note contains an idea, consider if it speaks to another idea already stored in you zettelkasten, or it it's a new idea you'd like to develop. If the idea is one you aren't ready to examine, send it down to you Sleeping folder if it isn't there already.
