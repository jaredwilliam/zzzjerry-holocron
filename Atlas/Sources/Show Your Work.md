## A New Way of Operating
If you focus on getting really good, you really don't need to find an audience, they will find you. But you need to be findable. There is an easy way of putting your work out there and making it discoverable *while* you're focused on getting really good. 

Instead of maintaining absolute secrecy and hoarding their work, they're open about what they're working on, and they're consistently posting bits and pieces of their work, their ideas, and what they're learning online. 

## You Don't Have to be a Genius
Many of the people who we think of as long geniuses were actually part of "a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other's work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas."

Being a valuable part of a "scenius" is not necessarily about how smart or talented you are, but about what you have to contribute - the ideas you share, the quality of the connections you make, and the conversations you start.
