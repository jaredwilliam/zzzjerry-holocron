Person 1: Suppose you have two pebbles. In what ways are they different?

Person 2: (One is rounder, one is darker, etc.)

P1: Yes, agreed. Now tell me which one is 'pebblier'.

P2: What?

P1: Which one is a better example of a pebble? Which is the better pebble?

P2: Well, they are both pebbles. Either can't be any more or less of a pebble than the other. 

P1: Agreed! So in some way, they are different - rounder, heavier - and in another way they are equal - they are both 100% pebbles. 

P2: Yeah. OK. So what?

P1: I would like to reintroduce you to a word you already know - "convention". A convention is a quality we can measure.. weight, color, smoothness, temperature, hardness, whatever you like. Every conventional measurement is relative to something else… heavier, greener, hotter, whatever. 

But each pebble, itself, not compared to anything else, is just a pebble. In other words, we can actually choose to perceive, see, or understand the pebble only as a pebble… because we know it's not a fork or a pencil. We know what it "is" or what it is "being".

Another word for "is" or "being" is "exist". The pebble is a pebble. The pebble exists as a pebble. Those last two sentences mean the same thing. 

When we measure something compared to something else, it is a "conventional" measure. To say a pebble is round means comparing it to something else similarly round. 

But whatever it is, in this case, a pebble, it "is" before we start to describing it with conventional terms like "heavy" and "smooth". The something has to exist before it can be compared to something else. 

The existence of that something, by itself, before being compare to something else, is that something's "existential" existence. When we refer to something "existentially", we are talking about the thing itself, without comparing it to something else, which again is a conventional description. 

So existentially, everything is exactly what it is supposed to be. A pebble is exactly a pebble. That also means the pebble is existentially 'perfect'… it is exactly what it is. It is inherently perfect because it's not supposed to be anything else. 

If something is exactly what it is supposed to be then there is no reason to compare it to anything else. That thing has no conventional flaws. We have to conclude that thing is existentially perfect. 

P2: Wouldn't you rather have a diamond than a pebble?

P1: Sure, the diamond is conventionally worth more. But existentially, the pebble is as perfect as the diamond. We can understand this better by asking a different question. Is Lebron James better than you? 

P2: What do you mean by better?

P1: That's the point. In some ways, LeBron James is better than you and I. He's better at basketball. But regardless, do you and I deserve the same respect and basic rights that Lebron deserves, even though he is better at basketball? Existentially, you, I, LeBron, and everyone else have equal value. 

What the point of all this?

There is both personal and social ramifications to deciding whether to existentially or conventionally judge the value of something. For example, judging ourselves. Everyone has doubts about themselves, about situations, whatever. That's normal. People want to be better at making money, having relationships, etc.

But, they also want to feel accepted just because they are who they are. That's existential. Existentially, they want to have the same respect and fair treatment they feel everyone deserves. 

And when they feel the world doesn't respect them, they suffer. 

The big point here is that human suffering comes from conventional measures. When a person thinks of some version of "I'm not good enough…", it is a conventional measure. 

But one can choose, to train themselves, to not think conventionally and instead think, "I am ok just because I am. I am not supposed to be anyone else. I understand I may have to take conventional actions to get what I need, but me, to me, only about me, is existentially perfect and need not suffer."
