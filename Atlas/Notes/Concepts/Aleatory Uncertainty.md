Aleatory Uncertainty refers to the type of uncertainty that arises from inherent randomness or chance within a system or process. In simple terms, it's the unpredictability that comes from natural variability, and it's something we can't eliminate or reduce by gathering more information. 

For example
- Rolling a die - no matter how many times you roll a fair six-sided die, you can't predict the exact number that will come up next. Each roll is random, and this randomness is an example of aleatory uncertainty. 
- Weather fluctuations - even with the most advanced technology, we can't predict weather conditions with 100% accuracy because of the random elements involved in atmospheric processes.

**Key Characteristics**
- Inherent randomness - aleatory uncertainty is built into the system; it's the "luck of the draw"
- Irreducible uncertainty - you can't reduce this type of uncertainty by collecting more data or improving your methods
- Statistical modeling - we use [[Probability Distributions]] (like the [[Normal Distribution]]) to model and understand this randomness.
