The choice of how to express numbers, which in turn can influence the impression given to audiences. For example, "5% mortality" sounds worse than "95% survival". 

A classic example is an advertisement that appeared in London in 2011, proclaiming that '99% of young Londoners do not commit serious youth violence'. The ads were presumably intended to reassure passengers about their city, but we could reverse its emotional impact with two simple changes. First, the statement means that 1% of young Londoners *do* commit serious violence. Second, since the population of London is around 9 million, there are around 1 million people aged between 15 and 25, and if we consider these as 'young', this means there are 1% of 1 million or a total of 10,000 seriously violent young people in the city. 

The two tricks used to manipulate the impact of a statistic: flip the framing (positive to negative or negative to positive) and change the format of the number (percentages to actual number or actual numbers to percentages).

Ideally, both positive and negative frames should be presented if we want to provide impartial information.
