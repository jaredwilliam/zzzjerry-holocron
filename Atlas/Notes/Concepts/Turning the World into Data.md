If we are going to use statistical science to gain insight into the world, then our daily experiences have to turn into data. 

To do so, we have to start with rigorous definitions of "things". For example, if we were asking "How many trees are there on the planet?", we would have to agree on that a "tree" is, which may seem simple, but we would have to distinguish between a shrub and a bush in our counting.
