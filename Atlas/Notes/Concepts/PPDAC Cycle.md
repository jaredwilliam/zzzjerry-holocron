The first stage of the cycle is specifying a **Problem**. Statistical inquiry always starts with a question. 
- Understanding and defining the problem.
- How do we go about answering this question?

The second stage is to **Plan**. Confident conclusions can only be drawn from a study which has been appropriately designed. 
- What to measure and how?
- Study design?
- Recording?
- Collecting?

Third is **Data**. Collecting good data required the king of organizational and coding skills that are being seen as increasingly important in [[Data Science]]. 
- Collection
- Management
- Cleaning

Fourth is **Analysis**. Usually this is the main emphasis of courses, but sometimes a simple visualization will do. 
- Sort data
- Construct tables, graphs
- Looks for patterns
- Hypothesis generation

Finally, the key to good statistical science is drawing appropriate **Conclusions** that fully acknowledge the limitations in the evidence, and communicate them clearly.
