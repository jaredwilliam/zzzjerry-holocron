## Scope and Abstraction
A concept is more abstract and developed as compared to an Idea. It usually refers to a generalized understanding or framework around which multiple ideas can be organized. Concepts tend to be broader, more structured, and more applicable across different situations. For example, "Renewable energy" is a concept that includes various ideas, such as solar, wind, and hydropower.  

## Level of Development
Concepts require deeper cognitive processing and organization. They often require critical thinking, synthesis of multiple ideas, and may lead to a theory or framework. For example, a concept involves an underlying principle or theme that applies to different situations, like "social learning" or "gamification".

## Role in Thinking
A concept serves as a tool for understanding and organizing knowledge. It represents a mental construct or category that helps explain or unify different phenomena. For example, the concept of "ergonomics" applies to various ideas about how to design a workspace that promotes health and productivity. 

## Relationship to Ideas
Concepts often act as frameworks through which we can generate and evaluate new ideas.
