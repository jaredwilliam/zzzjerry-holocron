**Interstitial journaling** is a [[Productivity]] and [[Mindfulness]] technique where you record your thoughts, tasks, and reflections throughout the day as they occur. Instead of [[Journaling]] once at the end of the day, you make brief entries between activitiesâ€”hence the term "interstitial," meaning "between spaces." This method helps you stay focused, track your progress, and reflect on how you're spending your time in real-time.

**Benefits of Interstitial Journaling:**

- **Increased Awareness:** Helps you become more mindful of how you spend your time.
- **Enhanced Productivity:** Allows you to monitor task transitions and reduce time lost between activities.
- **Improved Reflection:** Provides immediate insights into your thoughts and feelings, making end-of-day reflections more meaningful.
