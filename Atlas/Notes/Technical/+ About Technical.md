## Purpose
A **Technical Note** is designed to document procedural or instructional information that explains how to accomplish a specific task or process. These notes are particularly useful for capturing technical workflows, coding techniques, programming solutions, or instructions on how to use a tool or technology. The goal is to have a clear, concise resource for solving common technical problems or referencing coding practices. 

## Use Cases
- Documenting **programming techniques** (e.g., how to do list comprehension in Python).
- Capturing **workflow processes** (e.g., steps to deploy a web application).
- Storing **troubleshooting steps** for common issues (e.g., how to fix a bug in a piece of software).
- Writing **how-to guides** for using tools or software (e.g., using Git for version control).

## Structure
Each Technical note includes:
1. **Summary**: A brief explanation of the technical process or topic.
2. **Steps/Instructions**: Step-by-step instructions for performing the task.
3. **Examples**: Concrete examples that demonstrate how to apply the technical process. 
4. **Use Cases**: A description of scenarios where this technique or process would be useful. 
5. **Related Concepts**: Links to other relevant technical concepts or related programming principles. 
6. **Further Reading**: Links to external resources or additional notes for more in-depth exploration (optional).

## How to Use in Knowledge System
- Link Technical Notes to broader **Concept** notes to shoe how specific techniques fit into larger programming paradigms or workflows. 
- Use **Dataview** to create dashboards that surface technical notes for specific languages, frameworks, or tools (e.g., all Python-related notes).
- Tag technical notes by language, tool, or type of technology to make them easier to find and reuse. 

## Tags and Metadata
- Always include the `type: technical` in the YAML frontmatter.
- Tag technical notes with relevant **topics** and **language/tools**.
