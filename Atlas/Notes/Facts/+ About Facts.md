## Purpose
A **Fact** note is used to document important factual information, events, or details that are valuable for reference or study. These can include historical events, scientific facts, definitions, or any other verifiable and objective information that you want to store and recall. The goal of a Fact note is to capture the essence of the event or detail and its significance within the knowledge system. 

## Use Cases
- Capturing **historical events** (e.g., [[The Crossing of the Delaware by George Washington]]).
- Recording **scientific facts** (e.g., [[The Speed of Light]]).
- Documenting **definitions** (e.g., the meaning of a technical term or concept).
- Storing **contextual information** that is important for understanding broader themes (e.g., key moments in a revolution, important discoveries in a field of study). 

## Structure
Each Fact note includes:
1. **Summary**: A brief description of the fact, event, or detail.
2. **Key Details**: Specific information that gives context to the fact. 
3. **Importance**: An explanation of why the fact is significant or relevant.
4. **Related Topics**: Links to other notes or concepts in the system that are relevant to this fact (e.g., related historical events or concepts).
5. **Sources**: Any references or resources used to support the fact (optional but recommended for historical and scientific facts).

## How to Use in the Knowledge System
- Link Fact notes to **Concept** notes to provide concrete examples or evidence supporting broader ideas. 
- Use **Dataview** to create dynamic lists of facts related to particular themes (e.g., historical events, scientific discoveries).
- Combine multiple related Fact notes into **MOCs** for a more comprehensive overview of a topic (e.g., "Key Events in American History").

## Tags and Metadata
- Always include the `type: fact` in the YAML frontmatter.
- Tag facts with relevant **topics** (e.g., history, science) for easy retrieval.
