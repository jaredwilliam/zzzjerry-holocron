## Objectives and Key Results
OKR stands for *Objectives and Key Results*.
- **Objectives** are statements of what you want to accomplish. They should be simple, straightforward, and make you excited. 
- **Key Results** are metrics that tell you whether you've accomplished your Objective. 

For example, a good OKR, as suggested by [[John Doerr]] would have the following structure:

*I will {**objective**} as measured by {**key results**}.*

## Workflow
Track goals over three time periods: quarterly, weekly, and daily. 
- Quarterly goals -> OKR
- Weekly goals -> Initiatives
- Daily goals -> Tasks

Use [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes?ref=marcusolsson.dev) and [Calendar](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin?ref=marcusolsson.dev) plugins to create notes from templates for each time period. Each periodic note embeds the higher level goals: The weekly note embeds the OKRs for the current quarter, and the daily note embeds the initiatives for the current week. This allows for tracking goals every step of the way. Using the [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd?ref=marcusolsson.dev) plugin helps making the workflow more convenient. 

### The OKR Index
The main OKR Index is a note where I outline my goals for the coming quarter. Each quarter is a second-level heading, broken down into different life categories. For me, these are: 
- **Personal**
- **Relationships**
- **Health and Well-Being**
- **Financial Independence**
- **Career**

### Every Quarter
When a new quarter is about to start, I create a new OKR from a template using the QuickAdd plugin and being drafting the key results. Finally, I link to the objective from the index note under the appropriate category. 

The OKR note defines my goal and how I will know I've accomplished it. While it is not necessary for this workflow, I like to connect each objective to one or more of [[My Core Principles]]. It helps me build up excitement for the objective if I know what core values I satisfy by accomplishing it.

### Every Week
At the start of every week, I use the Calendar plugin to create a weekly note from my weekly template. I use the weekly note to plan the coming week and review it afterward. 

I plan the week by creating *initiatives* based on the OKRs for the quarter. Initiatives are tasks that bring me closer to accomplishing my objective. Initiatives should be created as Leading Indicators -> [[Leading and Lagging Indicators]].

I embed the objectives for the current quarter form the index note to remind myself of my OKRs every week.

### Every Day
Starting the day, I open the Daily note and plan what I'll do for the day. My daily note also serves as my Inbox for the day containing fleeting notes which then get processed as soon as I can get to them. 

At the top of the daily note, I embed the initiatives from my weekly note. This way, I am reminded daily of what I want to accomplish during the week. Embedding notes this way gives me full traceability from my quarterly goals to my daily tasks.

## Finding Motivation
There are periods I go through where motivation and inspiration are hard to come by. When you're struggling to just get through the day, the last thing you need is to feel even worse for not keeping up with your goals. 

Instead of beating myself up when it happens, I try to create *forgiveness* systems in my life. Systems that make it easy to get back into again. Whatever the tool, system, or process I use, it has to be resilient to these low periods in my life. When I eventually find my way back, picking it up again has to be trivial. If I need to relearn or reconfigure an app before I am caught up, it is likely not going to happen. 

This workflow if properly set up enables that.
