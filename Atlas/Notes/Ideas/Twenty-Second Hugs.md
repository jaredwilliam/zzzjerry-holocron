## Idea
Establish the habit of having 20-second hugs with your child. Do this early in their life. It will be great when they are young, but the real payoff is when they get older. The hugs will be less frequent, but getting a 20 second hug from your teenager is going to mean so much because it is natural for the display of affection towards our parents to decrease as we transition into adulthood.
