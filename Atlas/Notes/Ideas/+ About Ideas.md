## Scope and Abstraction
An idea is often specific, spontaneous, and less developed than a concept. It can be a thought, suggestion, or mental image that occurs to someone. Ideas are typically the seeds or raw thoughts that can later develop into more fully formed concepts. For example, "What if we could use solar power for homes?" is an idea. 

## Level of Development
Ideas can often be fleeting or preliminary, existing as a starting point. They don't necessarily require deep thinking or formalization. Many ideas can be generated quickly, often as creative sparks. For example, an idea might be a mental image or flash of inspiration, like inventing a new kind of app for learning languages. 

## Role in Thinking
Ideas often serve as the building blocks of creativity and problem-solving. They are more fluid and can be generated through brainstorming or free-flowing thought. An ideas can also be subjective and personal. For example, the idea to build a standing desk cam from observing how sedentary lifestyles impact health. 

## Relationship
An ideas can develop into a concept when it becomes more formalized, structured, or generalized. Multiple related ideas can lead to the formation of a concept.
