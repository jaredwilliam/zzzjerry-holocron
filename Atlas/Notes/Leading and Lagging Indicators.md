Leading indicators simply measure inputs to a system, lagging indicators measure outputs. Lead measures are within your control, lag measures aren't. 

For example, if trying to lose weight, a leading indicator is the number of calories you consume or the amount of exercise you do. A lagging indicator would be your weight. 

The way in which lead measures influence lag measures is an important concept to keep in mind when we look at how this works with [[OKR - Objectives and Key Results|OKR]]. 

A lead measure is:
- A metric
- A measure of input into a system
- Something you have direct control over
- Something you can act on and change, like an action or task

A lag measure is:
- A metric
- A measure of output from a system
- Something you don't have direct control over
- Something that's already happened, a result of something
