- [[Minimalism]] gives you clarity and more freedom.
- PKM System
	- Smart Note Taking
		- Starting to learn and integrate taking *smart* notes is important because otherwise you will clutter your system, leading to more stress. 
		- Let go of the things in your head by capturing them externally. This allows your mind to relax. 
		- [[Writing is not the outcome of thinking, it is the medium in which thought occurs]]
		- Smart notes are smaller in length and are connected to each other. Connected thoughts allow you to naturally generate new ideas. Also prevents ever having to start with a blank page when writing an article/book/whatever. 
		- It is easier to work on multiple projects and ideas simultaneously because you write the current state of thought. 
		- Your brain will not rest until a task is finished, but it seemingly does not really distinguish the difference between *finished* and *written down*. Writing something down means your brain doesn't have to remember it. 
		- When taking notes, it is essential to stay open and even seek opposing opinions and challenge what you already know. 
		- Writing is thinking. Without writing, there is no thinking, no progress. The more you write, the more notes you take, and the better of a thinker you become. You'll read better with better questions in your mind. 
	- [[Building a Second Brain]] 
		- This is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we have gain through our experience. 
		- It uses the PARA folder structure - Project, Area, Resources, and Archive.
		- Try to keep no more than four levels of folders. 
		- When taking notes, remember to make them for your future self. 
	- [[Zettelkasten]]
		- This approach further dilutes the idea of a librarian who organizes books in main categories and sub-folder and focuses only on the thought at hand as an individual note. 
		- Three types of notes: Fleeting Notes (quick, informal), Literature Notes (bibliographic details and a summary of the source material), and Permanent Notes (long-term knowledge, written in your own words). 
		- For permanent notes, think about how they relate to what you are currently working on, current interests, or anything that currently may be something you think about. 
		- The goal is not just to collect ideas but also to develop arguments and discussions over time. 
		- Delete Fleeting Notes once you have processed them. 
	- [[Getting Things Done]]
		- What is the next action?
		- Finish every task you can do within 2 minutes immediately
		- Tasks are captured into an inbox and then review where they are made actionable. 
			- For example, you may have "change tires" in your inbox, but it becomes "call garage for appointment" as a next step. 
		- You can also put the next action into different lists by adding context such as: Next, Waiting, Scheduled, Someday, Call, Errand, Computer, etc. This helps with filtering. They are then assigned to a project and categorized further into personal/work. 
		- [The Six Horizons of Focus](https://gettingthingsdone.com/2011/01/the-6-horizons-of-focus/)
		- The point is to write everything down or capture it somehow because you brain is for *thinking*, not remembering.
