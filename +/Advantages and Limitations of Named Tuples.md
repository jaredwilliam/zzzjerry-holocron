# Advantages
1. **Immutability**: Once a `namedtuple` instance is created, it cannot be altered. This is useful for creating objects that should act as data stores without permitting accidental alteration. 
2. **Memory Efficient**: `namedtuple` is more memory-efficient than a regular Python class because it does not store attributes in a per-instance `__dict__`. This makes it a lightweight alternative for many use cases. 
3. **Readability**: The field names make it easier to understand the role of each data attribute. You're not limited to using integer indices, as is the case with regular tuples. 
4. **Type Safety**: Using named fields can help catch type errors that might go unnoticed with a list or a regular tuple. Your code will be easier to debug and maintain. 
5. **Unpacking**: Like tuples, `namedtuple` instances can be unpacked easily. 
6. **Build-in Methods**: `namedtuple` provides a couple of useful built-in methods like `_asdict()`, `replace()`, and `_fields`. 

# Limitations
1. **Immutability**: While immutability is an advantage in some cases, it can also be a limitation if you need to alter field values once they are set. 
2. **No Default Values**: `namedtuple` does not allow you to specify default values for fields. However, Python 3.7+ introduced [[dataclasses]] which overcome this limitation. 
3. **Limited Methods**: A `namedtuple` class comes with only a few built-in methods. If you need custom methods, you'll have to either subclass it (which is cumbersome) or use a full-fledged class. 
4. **Verbose Syntax for Multiple Field Types**: Unlike `dataclasses`, `namedtuple` doesn't provide a native way to specify the types of fields, although this can be worked around with comments or docstrings. 
5. **Compatibility**: Being part of the `collections` module, `namedtuple` is specific to Python and may not be easily translated to JSON or other data formats.
