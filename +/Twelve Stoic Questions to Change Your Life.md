[[Twelve Stoic Questions to Change Your Life]]

We often look for answers when it is really the questions that teach us the most. The right question at the right time can completely change the direction of your life. 

1. [[Who Are You Spending Time With]]
2. [[Is This In My Control]]
3. [[What Does Your Ideal Day Look Like]]
4. [[To Be or To Do]]
5. [[If I am Not For Me, Who Is]]
6. [[What Am I Missing by Choosing to Be Worried or Afraid]]

## 7. [[Are you doing your job? ]]

Everyone has a job in every moment. Sometimes it is a big job and sometimes it is a little job. But everyone has to know there job in an organization and in life and then ask yourself if you are doing it. Do not worry about another person's job.

If you aren't, why not? If you are, good, keep doing it. 

## 8. [[What is the most important thing?]]

What is the most important thing to you? What do you actually value? If you don't know what is important, how do you know you are putting it first?

All the other questions in life come after you have asked and answered this one. 

Seneca had this concept of "Euthymia" which is about knowing the path that you are on and not being distracted by the paths of other people who are crisscrossing yours. 

Knowing this makes it easy to focus on what matters and ignore what doesn't. 

## 9. [[Who is this for?]]

When you are making or doing anything, you have to keep in mind who it is for. This is why empathy is so important. What do people want? 

## 10. [[Does this actually matter?]]

So many things that we hold on to actually don't matter. Not just to you, but anyone at all. 

![[Is This Essential#^3d720d]]

When you eliminate the non-essential, you get the double benefit of doing the essential things better. 

Is whatever is bothering you matter in the big picture? People matter, your loved ones matter, doing your best matters. Everything else is irrelevant. 

## 11. [[Will this be alive time or dead time?]]

Are you going to use every second or are you going to be passive and wait?

What are you going to have to show for the time you spend? Treat every moment as alive time. 

If you choose alive time, you are always getting better, you are always moving forward. 

![[It is Not That Life is Short#^3c21b5]]

You always have the ability to make the most of this moment. 

## 12. [[Is this who I want to be?]]

Is this representative of the person that I see myself as or the person that I am trying to become? Am I giving in to a lower version of myself? Am I taking a shortcut? Is this something that the person that I see myself as wouldn't do?
