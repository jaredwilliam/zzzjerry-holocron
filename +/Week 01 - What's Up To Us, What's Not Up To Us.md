[[Epictetus]]'s handbook (the *[[Enchiridion]]*) begins with the most powerful exercise in all of [[Stoicism]]: the distinction between the things that are "up to us" (in our control) and the things that are "not up to us." It is this, the dichotomy of control, that is the first principle in the entire philosophy. We don't control many of the things we pursue in life - yet we become angry, sad, hurt, scared, or jealous when we don't get them. In fact, those emotions - those reactions - are about the only thing that we do control. If that is the only lesson you journal about or remember for this year, consider it a year well and philosophically lived.

> The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are external snot under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own . . ." - [[Epictetus]], *[[Discourses 2.5.4-5]]*

> Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control our opinion, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything of our own doing. We don't control our body, property, reputation, position, and in a word, everything not of our own doing. Even more, the things in our control are by nature free, unhindered, and unobstructed, while those not in our control are weak, slavish, can be hindered, and are not our own. - [[Epictetus]], *[[Enchiridion 1.1-2]]*

> We control our reasoned choice and all acts that depend on that moral will. What's not under our control are the body and any of its parts, our possessions, parents, siblings, children, or country - anything with which we might associate. - [[Epictetus]], *[[Discourses 1.22.10]]*
