[[Helldivers II]]

## Loadouts
Take a balanced yet mission specific loadout. 

### Three Loadouts for Terminids
**Laser Team Six** - Chaff Clearing
- Sythe for light armor
- Laser Cannon for medium and heavies

However, they don't have any stagger. So, 
- Stun grenades

For bug holes
- Grenade pistol

Strategems
- Laser guard dog
	- Can sub in rocket sentry, gas strike, or cluster strike
- Eagle strafing run
	- Obliterates bile spewers and good damage to chargers
- Orbital Precision strike
	- Delete button

This is meant to clear out chaff while team deals with bigger stuff. 

**The Litterbug**
- Commando
	- Best stagger in game.
- EAT
	- Hit the charger legs with the EAT while walking forward. This will clear the armor. Then hit the leg with the triple shot from the Bush Wacker.
- HMG Emplacement
	- Bugs don't attack it if you are not in it. 
- Arc Blitzer
	- Big stagger, no ammo
- Bush Wacker
	- Good for shriekers too
- Orbital Gatling Barrage
- Base incendiary grenades
	- for bug holes

Encourage team to use your stuff. 

**The Gun Nut**
- MG43 
	- Only use the 750 RPM mode to save ammo, or the 900 RPM "For Super Earth" mode to kill things in a hurry
	- Shoot charger butt after hitting it with a stun
- AR23 Guard Dog
	- Better burst damage and staggers enemies, unlike the laser variant
- Stun grenades
- Eruptor
- Orbital Gatling barrage or eagle napalm strike
	- For breaches
- Orbital Precision strike for heavies
- Bush Wacker for "oh shit" moments
- Be the front line for this. Make bug holes a priority. 


### Balance
- One support weapon to deal with heavy armor such as the Flamethrower, EATs, Rail Cannon, or Arc Thrower. 
- One stratagem to deal with swarms such Eagle airstrike, and Eagle cluster bombs.
- At least one stratagem to deal with heavy armor. Two if you don't have the support weapon to deal with heavy armor. Orbital cannon strikes, rail cannon strikes, orbital lasers, and 500 kg. 
- One defensive backpack such as the jump bag, shield, or rover. Shield is the preference.

### Mission Specific 
For example, taking the armor that provide extra grenades for bug hole or fabricator missions, or an extra heavy weapon/stratagem to deal with heavy armor. 

## Stratagems
- Supply backpack gives you stims. 
- Rail Cannon strikes can one hit all enemies expect Bile Titans.
	- I'm not sure if this is true for Chargers either. 
## Tactics
- Keep moving. Don't overstay your welcome. 
- Generally avoid patrols if you can. 
- Drop samples at extraction if you're nearby.
- You're allowed to run away form the objective and come back later. 
- The priority is the objective - don't get caught up in fighting. 
- Prone stance provides improved stamina regeneration, stealth, and explosive damage resistance
- Enfilading Fire 
- Build Guide (for fighting bots)
	- Defensive Kit
		- Heavy Armor with Fortified
			- Alternatively - a medium or light armor with fortified
		- Personal Shield strategy
		- Vitality booster
	- Offensive Kit
		- LAS-16 Sickle
		- Redeemer or Senator
		- Quasar Cannon
		- Eagle Airstrike
		- Stratagem of your choosing
