First, create a [[Virtual Environment]] with:

`python -m venv nameofenv`

Once created, activate it with:

`nameofenv\Scripts\activate`

You should now see the name of the environment to the left of the cursor input section. 

## Linked Notes
```dataview
TABLE file.cday AS "Created"
FROM "Evergreen" where contains(file.outlinks, [[Virtual Environment Setup]])
SORT file.cday DESC
```
