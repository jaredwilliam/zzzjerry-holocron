[[Make Honesty Your Only Policy]]

[[Marcus Aurelius]] did not like faux attempts at honesty. His point: if you have to say "I'm going to be honest with you here," you're casually saying that honesty is the exception and not the rule. 

> How rotten and fraudulent when people say they intend to give it to you straight. What are you up to, dear friend? It shouldn't need your announcement, but be readily seen, as if written on your forehead, heard in the ring of your voice, a flash in your eyes - just as the beloved sees it all in the lover's glance. In short, the straight-forward and good person should be like a smelly goat - you know when they are in the room with you. A calculated 'giving it to you straight' is like a dagger. There's nothing worse than a wolf befriending sheep. Avoid false friendship at all costs. If you are good, straightforward, and well-meaning it should show in your eyes and not escape notice.
