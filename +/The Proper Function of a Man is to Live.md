[[James Bond]]
[[Eulogy]]

> [!quote]
> I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet. The proper function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them. I shall use my time.  - [[Ian Fleming]], *[[You Only Live Twice]]*


The second half of the quote is also the eulogy read by M ([[Ralph Fiennes]]) at the end of *[[No Time to Die]]*.
