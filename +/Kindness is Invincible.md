[[On Handling Haters]]

# Notes
> Kindness is invincible, but only when it's sincere, with no hypocrisy or faking. For what can even the most malicious person do if you keep showing kindness and, if given the chance, you gently point our where they went wrong - right as they are trying to harm you?
> - Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*, 11.18.5.9A
