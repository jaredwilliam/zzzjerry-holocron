[[Creating]] something great like a movie or a speech or a book is a scary process. Its an act of [[Daring]], [[Insanity]], and [[Inspiration]]. Anyone that decides to [[Build or Make Something from Nothing]] needs to posses those [[Qualities]] in spades. It's also really hard and a lot of [[Work]]. That's where [[Notecards]] come in. They are [[Building Blocks]], creating a [[Foundation]] upon which the work can lay. They are the inches in the [[Game of Inches]] that is the sport of art of business.
