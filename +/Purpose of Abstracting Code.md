We want to write code in such a way so that it is abstracted and can be reused in multiple instances. If the code is written to only work with specific values or in certain situations, and we need to reuse that code somewhere else, we will have to copy/paste the code, and change it. 

So now we have similar code in multiple spots. What if we find that there was an error in our original code? We likely won't remember every single spot that we copy/pasted that code. 

If we abstract the code, we can make the code more flexible, easier to maintain, and easier to fix.
