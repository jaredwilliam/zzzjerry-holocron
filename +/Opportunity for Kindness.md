[[Practice Love]]

Seneca said that whenever he encountered another human being he saw an opportunity for kindness. 

> A benefit should be kept like a buried treasure, only to be dug up in necessity. . . . Nature bids us to do well by all. . . . Wherever there is a human being, we have an opportunity for kindness.
> - Seneca, *On The Happy Life*, 24.2-3
