[[Basement Finishing]]

- Rigid Foam board insulation directly onto the walls
- Cut to size by measuring from floor to ceiling
	- Use [[Chalk Reel]] or [[Chalk Line]]
	- Trim off anything not needed (like around windows) after it's on the wall
- Put foam board at bottom of wall (on floor), apply adhesive to back, stand up and stick to wall. 
- Lean something heavy against it while adhesive dries
