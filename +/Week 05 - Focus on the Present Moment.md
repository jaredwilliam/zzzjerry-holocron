## Lesson
[[Marcus Aurelius]] ruled at a particularly turbulent time. Wars erupted on multiple fronts. Terrible plagues ravaged Rome. His rule was certainly one of constant, unrelenting pressure. But he never let it overwhelm him. from the [[Stoics]] and from the example of his adoptive father, the Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], Marcus found a coping strategy in always sticking close to the present moment and the duties at hand. When our own stress boils over, we can remember his practices and exercises, to stick with what is in front of us and not everything it might mean.
