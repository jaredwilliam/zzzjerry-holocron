4. Open Git Bash (or any terminal, but Git Bash seems to be the most useful) on your computer and change the current working directory to the location of where you want to clone the repository. 
	1. This will add a new folder within the directory you navigate to. So if you navigate to `C://Users/UserName` and run the cloning commands, a new folder will appear that look like `C://Users/UserName/RepoName`. I have made the mistake of making a project folder beforehand and ended up having directory names look like `C://Users/UserName/ProjectName/RepoName` where the Project Name and Repo Name were the same, and it seemed redundant. 
5. Clone the repository by typing `git clone <repository URL>` into Git Bash
	1. Right click to find the paste option
