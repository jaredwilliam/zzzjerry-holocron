[[Accepting What Is]]

[[Epictetus]] taught that we get a well-flowing life when we wish for what is going to happen not what we want to happen, and [[Marcus Aurelius]] added that we should meet anything that comes our way with gratitude. Not "I wish this was different, but I'll tolerate it"; instead "I am glad it happened this way. It is for the best."
