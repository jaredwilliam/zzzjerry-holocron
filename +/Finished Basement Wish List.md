[[Basement Finishing]]

- Bar including small sink
- Wine and beer fridge
- Spot to mount projector on ceiling (?) - people might hit their heads unless it can go on opposite wall. But then we have to worry about people sitting in front or walking in front of it, so it might be easier and more flexible if we just have a small table to set it out.
- Spot to hang projector screen. 
- Spot for sound bar
- Space for turn table
