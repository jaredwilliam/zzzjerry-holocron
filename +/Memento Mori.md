## Summary

Memento Mori (Latin) is a concept that I learned from [[Ryan Holiday]] that means "remember that you have to die". 

It is supposed to act as a reminder of the inevitability of death and to not waste your time, as it is precious. Everything you do should matter because you are using up your most precious resource to do it. 

> Let us prepare our minds as if we'd come to the very end of life. Let us postpone nothing. Let us balance life's books each day. The one who puts the finishing touches on their life each day is never short of time.
> 
>- Seneca
