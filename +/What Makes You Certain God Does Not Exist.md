The oldest known single-celled fossils on Earth are 3.5 billion years old. Mammals first appeared about 200 million years ago. The last common ancestor for all modern apes (including humans) existed about 13 million years ago with anatomically modern man emerging within the last 300,000 years.

Another 298,000 years would pass before a small, local blood-cult would co-opt the culturally predominant deity of the region, itself an _aggregate_ of the older patron gods that came before. 350 years later, an imperial government would [declare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edict_of_Thessalonica) that all people within a specific geopolitical territory _must_ believe in the same god or be exiled - at best. And now, after 1,500 years of crusades, conquests and the countless executions of "heretics," a billion people wake up early every Sunday morning to prepare, with giddy anticipation, for an _ever-imminent,_ planet destroying apocalypse that they are [helping to create](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-will-bring-about-end-worldevangelicals-end-times-779643) - but [hoping to avoid](https://www.raptureready.com/).

At what point in our evolution and by what mutation, mechanism or environmental pressure did we develop an immaterial and eternal "soul," presumably excluded from all other living organisms that have ever existed?

Was it when now-extinct Homo erectus began cooking with fire 1,000,000 years ago or hunting with spears 500,000 years ago? Is it when now-extinct Neanderthal began making jewelry or burying their dead 100,000 years ago? Is it when _we_ began expressing ourselves with art 60,000 years ago or music 40,000 years ago? Or maybe it was when we started making pottery 18,000 years ago, or when we began planting grain or building temples to long-forgotten pagan gods 10,000 years ago.

Some might even suggest that we finally started to emerge from the stone age when written language was introduced just 5,600 years ago. While others would maintain that identifying a "rational" human being in _our_ era may be the hardest thing of all, especially when we consider the comment sections of many popular websites.

Or perhaps that unique "spark" of human consciousness that has us believing we are special enough to outlast the physical Universe may, in part, be due to a mutation of our mandible that would have weakened our jaw (compared to that of other primates) but increased the size of our cranium, allowing for a larger prefrontal cortex.

Our weakened bite encouraged us to cook our meat making it easier to digest, thus providing the energy required for powering bigger brains and triggering a feed-back loop from which human consciousness, as if on a dimmer-switch, emerged over time - each experience building from the last.

This culminated relatively recently with the ability to attach abstract symbols to ideas with enough permanence and detail (language) to effectively be transferred to, and improved upon, by subsequent generations.

_After all this,_ it is proclaimed that _all_ humanity is _born_ in disgrace and _deserving_ of eternal torture by way of an ancient curse. But believing in the significance of a [vicarious](https://youtu.be/By9JJSVzlTw) blood sacrifice and conceding our lives to "_mysterious ways_" guarantees pain-free, conspicuously opulent immortality.

Personally, I would rather not be spoken to that way.

If a cryptozoological creature - seemingly confabulated from a persistent mythology that is enforced through child indoctrination - _actually exists,_ and it's of the sort that promises eternal torture of _its own design_ for those of us not easily taken in by extraordinary claims, perhaps for the good of humanity, instead of worshiping it, we should be seeking to _destroy_ it.
