#dailystoic

If the first step is to discern what is or isn't in our control, the second is to focus our energy on the things we have a choice about. The Stoics viewed the soul as a sphere that, when well tuned, well directed, was an invincible fortress against any trial or circumstance. Protected by our reason, this sphere of choice (*prohairesis*) is like a sacred temple and is the only thing we truly possess in life. We are the product of our choices, so it is essential then that we choose well. This week, consider and reflect on the choices you have: about your emotions, your actions, your beliefs, and your priorities.

> Keep this thought at the ready at daybreak, and through the day and night - there is only one path to happiness, and that is in giving up all outside of your sphere of choice, regarding nothing else as your possession, surrendering all else to God and Fortune. - [[Epictetus]], *[[Discourses 4.4.39]]*

> The soul is a sphere, true to itself. It neither projects itself toward any external thing nor does it collapse on itself, but instead radiates a light which it shows itself the truth of all things and the truth in itself. - [[Marcus Aurelius]], *[[Meditations 11.12]]*
