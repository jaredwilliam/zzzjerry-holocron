- Streams are for fast twitch thinking and acting. There is a fast feedback loop with slightly longer undercurrent of connection building. 
- How do we build and maintain our own personal information gardens? Not streams, but environments we can tend and grow over decades.
- *A Digital Garden is the "web as topology". It doesn't collapse to a single set of relations of canonical sequence. Every walk through the garden creates a new path and new meanings.* 
- *As with an actual garden and each flower, tree, and vine, everything in the garden is seen in relation to the whole.* 
- *With a stream, you don't experience it by walking around it or looking at it, you jump in and let it flow past. You feel the force of it hit you.* 
- *You don't have to be passive in the stream, you can be active. But your actions in there -  blog posts, mentions, comments - exist in a context that is collapsed down to a simple timeline of event that together form a narrative.* 

## Streams, Campfires, and Gardens
Streams - fast twitch information discovery (e.g., Twitter). The firehose of content. 

Campfires - blogging. Slower burn but fade relatively quickly (over the timeframe of years). Connection forming. Thinking out loud. Self-referencing. This builds muscle and helps articulate thinking and is the connective tissue between ideas, people, etc. 

Gardens - The wiki layer. A place to store and evolve longer-term thinking. See [[Building a Digital Garden]]
