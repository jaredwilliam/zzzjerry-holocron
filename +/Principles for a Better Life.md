[[Ryan Holiday]] has an Instagram post where he lists nine rules that he believes lead to a better life. Those nine rules are:
1. [[Wake up early]]
2. [[Focus on effort, not results]]
3. [[Read every day]]
4. [[Strict with yourself, forgiving of others]]
5. [[Seek out challenges]]
6. [[Stay a student]]
7. [[Cut toxic people out of your life]]
8. [[Think about death]]
9. [[Focus on what you can control]]

I have created each of them into links because I think that each one could be a whole topic to explore - maybe each one could even be a future book.
