## 1. Compound Yourself
- Exponential curves are the key to wealth generation. 
- It's worth a lot of effort to find and create the business that grow 50% in value every year. 
- Put yourself on an exponential curve as well - move towards a career that has a compounding effect - most careers progress fairly linearly. 
- Your rate of learning should always be high. 
- As your career progresses, each unit of work you do should generate more and more results. There are many ways to get this leverage, such as capital, technology, brand, network effects, and managing people. 
- It is useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric - money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. 
- Take as much time as needed between projects to find the next big thing, but always strive for it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of your career look like a footnote. 
- Don't let yourself get bogged down in linear opportunities. Be willing to let small opportunities go to focus on potential step changes. 

## 2. Have Almost Too Much Self-Belief
- The most successful people believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion. 
- Collect data points that show your judgement is good and you can consistently deliver results, leading you to trust yourself more. 
- Managing your own morale - and your team's morale - is one of the greatest challenges of most endeavors. 
- Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. 

## 3. Learn to Think Independently
- Schooling generally does not reward original thinking, so you have to cultivate it on your own. 
- Thinking from first principles and trying to generate new ideas is fun, and finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. Then you need to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world. 
- One of the most powerful lessons to learn is that you can figure out what to do in situations that seem to have no solution. Grist comes from learning you can get back up after you get knocked down. 

## 4. Get Good at "Sales"
- Self-belief alone is not sufficient - you have to be able to convince other people of what you believe. 
- Getting good at communication - particularly written communication - is an investment worth making. To communicate clearly, first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language. 
- Believe in what you are selling. 
- Show up in person whenever it is important. 

## 5. Make it Easy to Take Risks
- Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. 
- Taking risks is important because it's impossible to be right all the time. 
- Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you're wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction. 

## 6. Focus
- Focus is a force multiplier on work. 
- Spend more time thinking about what to focus on. 
- It is much more important to work on the right thing that it is to work many hours. 
- Don't waste your time on stuff that doesn't matter. 
- Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. 
- Slow-moving people do not become very successful. 

## 7. Work Hard
- You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both - you will be competing with other very talented people who will have great ideas and be willing to work a lot. 
- Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life-tradeoffs, and it's perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success. 
- One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. 
- You have to figure out how to work hard without burning out. 
- People who pretend you can be super successful professionally without working most of the time (for some period of your life) are doing a disservice. Work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success. 
- Hard word compounds like interest. 

## 8. Be Bold
- People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters. 
- If you are making progress on an important problem, you will have a constant tailwind of people wanting to help you. Let yourself grow more ambitious, and don't be afraid to work on what you really want to work on. 
- Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too. 

## 9. Be Willful
- A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time - most people don't even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. 
- A combination of self-doubt, giving up too early, and not pushing hard enough prevents most people from ever reaching anywhere near their potential. 
- Ask for what you want. You usually won't get it, and often the rejection will be painful. But when it works, it works surprisingly well. 
- Almost always, the people who say "I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are, I'm going to figure them out", and mean it, go on to succeed. 
- To be willful, you have to be optimistic. There are no successful pessimistic people. 

## 10. Be Hard to Compete With
- If what you can do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money. 
- The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. 
- If you're doing the same thing that everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with. 

## 11. Build a Network
- Great work requires teams. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish. 
- An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. 
- One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. Be overly generous with sharing the upside - it will come back to you 10x. 
- Learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. 
- You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out. 
- Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. 
- Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don't let them stop you from doing what you want to do. 
- The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are. 
- When trying to evaluate someone on intelligence, drive, creativity, etc., mostly look at rate of improvement, and don't overvalue experience or current accomplishment. 
- Ask yourself when meeting someone new, "Is this person a force of nature?" If so, they are likely to accomplish great things. 
- Spend your time with positive people who support your ambitions. 

## 12. You Get Rich by Owning Things
- You don't get rich with high salaries (with the exceptions of uber-successful entertainers). 
- You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value (a piece of a business, real estate, natural resources, intellectual property, etc.)
- Somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly. 
- The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale. 

## 13. Be Internally Driven
- Most people are primarily externally driven - they do what they do because they want to impress other people. This is bad for many reasons, but here are two important ones:
- First, you will work on consensus ideas and on consensus career tracks. You will care a lot - much more than your realize - if other people think you're doing the right thing. This will probably prevent you from doing truly interesting work, and even if you do, someone else would have done it anyway. 
- Second, you will usually get risk calculations wrong. You will be very focused on keeping up with other people and not falling behind in competitive games, even in the short term, 
- Being aware of this externally-driven behavior helps avoid it, but only a little. You will have to work hard to not fall in the [[Mimetic]] trap. 
- The most successful people are primarily internally driven - they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world.
