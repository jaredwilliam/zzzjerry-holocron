#dailystoic

Each day you write in this journal, you'll be following in the footsteps of [[Epictetus]], [[Marcus Aurelius]], and all the other great [[Stoics]]. The [[Stoics]] did not face each day on a whim, but instead with preparation and discipline. They spent real time thinking and anticipating what was to come over the course of a day, a week, a year. Each morning activity - [[Journaling]] included - was designed to make them ready to face the day. And with your work in this book, so you will be, too.

> Ask yourself the following first thing in the morning:
> - What am I lacking in attaining [[Freedom]] from [[Passion]]?
> - What for [[Tranquility]]?
> - What am I? A mere body, estate-holder, or reputation? None of these things. 
> - What, then? A rational being. 
> - What then is demanded of me? Meditate on your actions. 
> - How did I steer away from [[Serenity]]?
> - What did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring?
> - What did I fail to do in all these things?
> [[Epictetus]], *[[Discourses 4.6.34-35]]*

> On those morning you struggle with getting up, keep this though in mind - I am awakening to the work of a human being. Why them am I annoyed that I am going to do what I'm made for, the very things for which I was put into this world? Or was I made for this, to snuggle under the covers and keep warm? It's so pleasurable. Were you then made for pleasure? In short, to be coddled or to exert yourself? - [[Marcus Aurelius]], *[[Meditations 5.1]]*
