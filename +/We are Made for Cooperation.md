> When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks. They are all stricken with these afflictions because they don't know the difference between good and evil. Because I have understood the beauty of good and the ugliness of evil, I know that these wrongdoers are still akin to me . . . and that none can do me harm, or implicate me in ugliness - nor can I be angry at my relatives or hate them. For we are made for cooperation.
