> At every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a [[Roman]] and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice - giving yourself a break from all other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes it possible to live an abundant and devout life. 
> - [[Marcus Aurelius]], [[Meditations 2.5]]
