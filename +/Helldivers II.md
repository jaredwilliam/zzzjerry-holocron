Support Team by Being a Stealthy Saboteur
- Loadout
	- Armor
		- Scout armor
	- Weapons
		- Primary: Diligence Counter Sniper
		- Secondary: Grenade pistol
		- Grenade: Stuns
	- Strategems
		- Spear: you can target enemies through smoke. Allows you to support team from 300 meters away. 
		- Orbital Smoke Strike: On demand cover. Allows you to get away. 
		- Eagle Airstrike
		- Orbital Laser: meant for taking out bigger outposts, like AA emplacements or mortar pits. Not for enemies unless absolutely necessary. 
- We will be splitting off from the team regularly. 
- Focus on strategems that add utility rather than most lethal.
- Split off from your team for one of two reasons:
	- To take care of high-priority objectives (detector towers, mortar pits, heavy outposts, stratagem jammers)
	- Clear a path that your team is likely to take
- Use mini-map to make decisions
	- Meaning, try to figure out where the team is going and clear it out so there is more breathing room. For example, if there is a large outpost right in the middle, go take care of that. 
- Dump aggro to lose the bots
	- Eliminate any threat but retreat as soon as you're able and break line of site as often as possible
- Evade the enemy
	- Lose the tail. 
	- Use support weapon call-in when you need more ammo
	- Find ways to sneak past patrols and use cover
	- 


There is a spot beneath the detector tower that will allow you to take it out with a Hell Bomb without going into the base. Avoid the red beam.
