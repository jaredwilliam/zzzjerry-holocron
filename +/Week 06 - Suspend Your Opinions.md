[[Epictetus]] would teach that opinions were "the cause of a troubled mind". [[Opinions]] about the way we think things should be, need to be. One of the [[Stoic]] words for "opinion" is "[[Dogma]]". The practice of [[Stoicism]] begins with a relentless attempt to suspend this dogmatic way of living - a cessation of the belief that you can force your opinions and expectations onto the world.
