> Whenever you have trouble getting up in the morning, remind yourself that you’ve been made by nature for the purpose of working with others, whereas even unthinking animals share sleeping. And it’s our own natural purpose that is more fitting and more satisfying.  
> —Marcus Aurelius, _Meditations_, 8.12

The Stoic concept of "synergia" translates to "working together" or "cooperation" in English. This is central to Stoicism's emphasis on social duty and community welfare. According to [[Stoicism]], human beings are rational, social animals, and their natural state is one of cooperation with others. Synergia emphasizes that individual well-being is intimately connected to the well-being of the community, and as such, it encourages actions that are mutually beneficial.

The phrase "_praxeis koinonikas apodidonai_" could be translated as "performing social duties." It aligns closely with the concept of synergia. This phrase speaks to the Stoic principle that individual actions should aim for mutual benefit. Stoics argue that each of us has a role in a larger community and a set of social duties to fulfill, much like a limb has a role in the larger organism. It isn't just a call for random or trivial acts of kindness but rather an intrinsic part of living in accordance with nature and reason.

If a dog spends all day in bed—your bed, most likely—that’s fine. It’s just _being_ a dog. It doesn’t have anywhere to be, no other obligation other than being itself. According to the [[Stoics]], we humans have a higher obligation—not to the gods but to each other. What gets us out of bed each morning—even when we fight it like [[Marcus Aurelius]] did—is _praxeis koinonikas apodidonai_ (to render works held in common). Civilization and country are great projects we build together and have been building together with our ancestors for millennia. We are made for cooperation (_synergia_) with each other.

The intersection of synergia and "_praxeis koinonikas apodidonai_" can offer a structured lens through which one can approach personal development, career, or even social interactions. 

So if you need an extra boost to get out of bed this morning, if you need something more than caffeine can offer, use this. People are depending on you. Your purpose is to help us render this great work together. And we’re waiting and excited for you to show up.
