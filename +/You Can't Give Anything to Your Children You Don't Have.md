> You can't give anything to your children that you don't already have. - [[Kristen Bell]]

Heard this on the [[Conan O'Brian]] podcast, [[Conan Needs a Friend]].

I thought it was pretty neat thought at first but my mind immediately went to material possessions, like money. 

But she made the point to say "like a positive body image", which really made an impression on me. If you want your children to have a positive body image, or to be brave, or confident, or curious, you have to teach them how to do or be those things. And one can only teach something that you know. 

So to instill those characteristics into your children, you have to instill them into yourself first.
