[[One Cannot Think Without Writing|One Cannot Think Without Writing]]

## Introduction

- Every intellectual endeavor starts with a note. 
- The process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down the argument is the smallest part of its development. 
- Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it the *medium* of all this work. 
- The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on *what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic*. 
- It is not so important who you are, but what you do. 
	- *How naturally talented you are doesn't matter as much as how much self-discipline or self control one uses to approach a task.
- Self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves - and the environment can be changed. Not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organization of writing and note-taking comes into play. 

### 1. Everything You Need to Know
- A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together *in your head* and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument, and the ideas. 
- Having a clear structure to work *in* is completely different from making plans *about* something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure *on yourself*; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open ended process like research, thinking, or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding, or achievement. The challenge is to structure one's workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. 
- Writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing. 

#### 1.1 Good Solutions are Simple - and Unexpected
- There is no need to build a complex system and there is no need to reorganize everything you already have. 
	- *This is an idea that I have been trying to teach myself lately as I tend to over-complicate everything I work on. I also love reorganizing, probably because it feels productive without actually having to do anything difficult.*
- The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. 
	- *[[Conway's Game of Life]] - a demonstration that complex patterns can come from a few simple rules. If you make a system with complex rules, you set yourself up for failure because it will be too hard to maintain. Complexity will appear on its own. Focus on making it as simple as possible for yourself.*
-  Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly. Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place. 
- The secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent. Even the best tools won't make much of a difference if they are used in isolation. Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working process can the tools play out their strengths. There is no point in having great tools if they don't fit together. 

#### 1.2 The Slip-Box
- The Slip-Box was [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s way of organizing his notes that caused him to be massively productive in his academic career. It allowed to him to not feel so stressed and he never forced himself to do something he didn't feel like. He even said: "I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else."
- The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. 
- Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place. This is not just about having the right mindset, it is also about having the right workflow. It is the way [[Niklas Luhmann]] and his slip-box worked together that allowed him to move freely and flexibly between different tasks and levels of thinking. It is about having the right tools and knowing how to use them - and very few understand that you need both. 

#### 1.3 The Slip-Box Manual
- [[Niklas Luhmann]] had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. When he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side. He would then look at his notes and think about how it applied to his work. Then would write his ideas, comments, and thoughts on new pieces of paper, putting only one idea on each card. These went into his main slip-box. 
- He wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes.
- While notes were brief, he wrote them with great care, as if he was writing them for a final manuscript - full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew material. 
- He made references to other notes, sometimes obviously related, other times not so much. 
- He did *not* just copy ideas or quotes, but translated it to be his own words and to be context independent. 
- Each note had a unique id number only meant to identify the note.
- Whenever he added a note, he checked his slip-box for other relevant notes to make possible connections between them. 
- By adding links, you can add the same note to different contexts. 
- Topics are developed bottom-up. 

### 2. Everything You Need to Do
- Writing notes is *not* the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome. Writing notes *accompanies* the main work, and done right, it helps with it. 
- Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. 
- If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. 
- Notes do not make intellectual endeavors easier; notes make them possible. 

#### 2.1 Writing a Paper Step By Step
1. Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Just capture them in any way you can and put them in one place, called an inbox, and process them later. If the thought is already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step. 
2. Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, write down what you don't want to forget or think you might use in your own work. Keep is short, be selective, and use your own words. 
3. Make permanent notes. On a daily basis, go through the notes created in steps 1 and 2 and think about how they relate to what is relevant to your work, research, thinking, or interests. The idea is not to *collect*, but to *develop* ideas, arguments, and discussions. 
	1. Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references, and try to be as precise, clear, and brief as possible. Throw away the fleeting notes and put the literature notes into your reference system. 
4. Add your new permanent notes to the slip-box by:
	1. Filing each one behind one or more related notes
		1. *I'm not sure this step applies to a digital system*
	2. Add links to related notes
		1. *Is there a way to have different links? I.e., one type of link for "directly related" and other links for tangentially related?*
	3. Link to this new note from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a topic and is itself linked to the index. 
		1. *Dataview should be able able to simplify this index*
5. Develop your topics, questions, and research projects bottom up from within the system. Read more to challenge, strengthen, change, and develop your arguments. Just follow your interests and take the path that promises the most insight. Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where the chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters. 
6. Topics to explore or write about will naturally comes out of this process based on the notes that you have. Just follow the links. 
7. Collect those linked notes and turn it into a rough draft. 
8. Edit and proofread. 

- You are basically writing multiple papers/articles at one time. We cannot help but to have multiple questions. This approach allows you to incrementally work on many ideas at a time, at different stages. 
- We constantly encounter interesting ideas along the way and only a fraction of them are useful for the particular project we are working on. 

### 3. Everything You Need to Have
- Focus on the essentials and don't complicate things unnecessarily. 
- Every little step in a complicated and/or poorly designed workflow suddenly becomes its own project without brining the whole much further forward. 
- Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help reduce distractions from the main work, which here is *thinking*. The slip-box provides and external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information. 

#### 3.1 The Toolbox
- Four tools: something to capture ideas, a reference management system, the slip-box, a text editor. 
- You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head. Pen and papers, notes app, voice recording, etc. These are note meant to be permanent, but to only be a reminder of what the idea was. Process these within a day. 
- The reference system is meant to collect references and the notes you take during your reading. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)
- It doesn't matter what form your slip-box takes. If physical, you just need note cards. If digital, you just need to be able to set links and tags. 
- Doesn't matter what your editor is, but recommended to use one that is compatible with the reference manager. It'll make life easier. 

### 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind
- With any tool, we sometimes forget that the handling of the tool is as important as the possibilities of the tool itself. 
- To get the most out of a tool, it is crucially important not only to know how it work or how to work with it, but also why it works. 

## The Four Underlying Principles

### 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters
- By writing, you *demonstrate* what you have learned and show your ability to think critically and develop ideas. 
- An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. 
- The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin. If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing. 
- Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else *differently*. 
	- *Create your work as if you are going to have to present it to a room of people.*
- Writing will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything. You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don't understand what it is about. 
- And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do *deliberately*. 
- Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are going. If you change your mind about the importance of writing, you will also change your mind about everything else. Even if you decide never to write a single line of manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking, and other intellectual skills just by doing everything *as if nothing counts other than writing*. 

### 6. Simplicity is Paramount
- (On a story about how it took a bit of effort and failure for cargo ships to fully adopt using cargo containers) … The ship owners tried to integrate the container into their usual way of working without changing the infrastructure and their routines. 
	- *This is why developing new habits fail*. 
- Under the conventional system of note taking, we are asking ourselves "Under which topic do I store this note?". In the new system, the question becomes "In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?". 
- Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques, or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published. 
	- *This is like simplifying the end-to-end process to get something done, rather than trying to make each step perfect.*
- Even though the slip-box, being organized bottom-up, does not face the trade-off problem between too many or too few topics, it too can lose its value when notes are added to it indiscriminately. It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a critical mass, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled. To achieve a critical mass, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between three types of notes:
	- **Fleeting notes**, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way, and will end up in the trash within a day or two. 
	- **Permanent notes**, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either as literature notes in the reference system or written as if for print, in the slip-box. 
	- **Project notes**, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished. 
- Typical mistakes made:
	- (On capturing *every* idea and treating everything as a permanent note) - The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. On top of that, the strict chronological order  does not offer any help to find, combine, or rearrange ideas in a productive sense. 
	- Collecting notes only related to specific projects. It makes sense at first - you decide what you are going to write about and then collect everything that helps you do that. But the disadvantage is that you have to start all over after each project and cut off all other promising lines of thought. If you try to mitigate the effect by opening a new folder for every potential new project whenever you stumble upon something that might be interesting for that, you will soon end up with an overwhelming amount of unfinished projects. 
	- Treating all of your notes as fleeting ones. You can easily spot this approach by the mess that comes with it, or rather by the cycle of slowly growing piles of material followed by the impulse for major cleanups. 
- What these confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. It should be the opposite: the more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones - and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort. 
- Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. They are only meant to serve as a reminder of a thought. 
- Permanent notes are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. 
- Every permanent notes for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that cannot be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. 

### 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch
- You won't have to write from scratch if you take smart notes and build up a critical mass. You will be able to look at the graph and start to see ideas building up and those will be the topics you write about. 
- There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about. 
- The attempt of study guides to put the nonlinear writing process into a linear order is the main reason for the very problems and frustrations they promise to solve. How can you not have trouble finding a topic if you believe you have to decide on one before you have done your research, have read and learned about something? 
- But those who have already developed their thinking through writing can keep the focus on what is interesting for them at the moment and accumulate substantial material just by doing what they most feel like doing.
