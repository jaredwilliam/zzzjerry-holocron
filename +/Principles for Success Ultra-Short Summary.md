# The Call to Adventure

Ray’s success has more to do with knowing how to deal with what he doesn’t know than what he does know.

**Principle Number 1: You need to think for yourself about what is true.**

Principles are smart ways of handling things that happen over and over again in similar situations.

Unless you want to have a life that is directed by others, you need to decide for yourself what to do, and you need to have the courage to do it.

Time is like a river that carries us forward into encounters with reality that require us to make decisions. We cannot stop our movement down this river, and we cannot avoid the encounters. We can only approach them in the best possible way.

In your life, you are going to face millions of decisions, and the quality of your decisions is going to determine the quality of your life.

The most valuable things you will learn will be from the results of mistakes that you reflect on to help form principles so that you don’t make the same mistakes again.

It is not necessary to have a unique set of skills or background to have a successful life. It takes a unique approach to life, which almost anyone can adopt. It starts with embracing reality and dealing with it.

# Embrace Reality and Deal with It

The path you take in life is your most important decision.

Ray got successful by chasing after the things he wanted, crashed, got up and ran again, and crashed. And he time he crashed he learned something, got better, and crashed less. By doing that over and over again, he learned to love this process, even the crashing part of it. Through it, he encountered reality and learned how to deal with it.

**Principle Number 2: Truth is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.**

By “truth”, he doesn’t mean anything more than the way the world works. We were given the laws of reality by nature. Humans didn’t create them, but we can use them to foster our evolution and achieve our goals.

This caused Ray to become a hyper-realist, meaning he is someone who discovered the great rewards of deeply understanding, accepting, and working with reality as it is, and not as he wished it would be.

This doesn’t mean that dreams cannot come true. Without dreams, life is mundane. Hyper-realism is the best way to choose one’s dreams and then achieve them.

**Big Dreams + Embracing Reality + Lots of Determination = A Successful Life**

But what does a successful life look like? We each have to decide for ourselves.

Each of us chooses goals based on our values and decides on the best path to achieve them. But we all need approaches to making decisions that work well, especially when facing problems, mistakes, and weaknesses that stand in our way.

To succeed, we must embrace all our realities, especially the harsh realities that we wish weren’t true.

At first, looking at these harsh realities is going to cause you a lot of pain. But this pain is just psychological, and seeing things differently makes all the difference.

View problems like puzzles that will reward you if you solved them. They will help you with the problem at hand AND give you principles to help you with similar problems in the future.

Learn to treat pain as a cue, that a great learning opportunity is at hand.

**Pain + Reflection = Progress**

Meditation will be invaluable in helping you see things that way. When you calm yourself down, embraced your realities, and dealt with them, the rewards will bring you pleasure and the pain will fade.

Each of us has the unique capability to think logically, to reflect on ourselves, and our circumstances, and to direct our own personal evolution. Doing this well is just a matter of following a simple five-step process.

# The Five-Step Process

When we reflect on the mistakes that we make (e.g., through meditation), we can learn principles that will help us prevent making the same mistakes in the future.

Being successful simply consisted of five steps:

**Step 1 is to know your goals and to run after them. What is best for you depends on your nature, so you really need to understand yourself and know what you want to achieve in life.**

**Step 2 is to encounter the problems that stand in the way of getting to your goals. These problems are typically painful. If handled badly, some of them can lead to your ruin. But to evolve, you need to identify those problems and not tolerate them.**

**Step 3 is to diagnose these problems to get at their root causes. Don’t jump too quickly to solutions. Take a step back and reflect in order to really distinguish the symptoms from the disease.**

**Step 4 is to design a plan to eliminate the problems. This is where you determine what you need to do to get around them.**

**Step 5 is to execute those designs, pushing yourself to do what is needed to progress toward your goal.**

A successful life essentially consists of doing these five steps over and over again. This is your personal evolution and you see this process everywhere. This is just a law of nature. Look at any corporation, product, or person you know and you will see that this is true for them.

Evolution is simply a process of either adapting, or dying.

As you push through this often painful process, you’ll naturally ascend to higher and higher levels of success.

Ray found that when he did it better, his struggling never became easier, because the more capable he became, the greater the challenges he would take on.

Because people are strong and weak at different things, most people can’t do all five steps well. Not facing this reality means you could stretch further than your should. And as the heights get greater, your falls could also be greater.

Sometimes terrible things happen to all of us in life. They can ruin us, or they can profoundly improve us, depending on how we handle them.

# The Abyss

We progress forward until we encounter setbacks. Whether or not we get out of them and continue forward or spiral downward depends on whether or not we’re willing to face the failure objectively and make the right decisions to turn the loop upward again.

Ray thought very hard about the relationship between risk and reward and how to manage them. But he couldn’t see a path forward that would give him the rewards he wanted without unacceptable risk.

This kind of experience happens to everyone. It will happen to you. You will lose something, or someone you think you can’t live without. Or you will suffer a terrible illness or injury. Or your career will fall apart before your eyes. You might think that your life is ruined and that there is not way to go forward. But it will pass. There is always a best path forward and you probably just don’t see it yet. You just have to reflect well to find it. You have to embrace your reality.

# Everything is a Machine

Sometimes things happen that are hard to understand. Life often feels so difficult and complicated, it’s too much to take in all at once. Ray’s deep pain allowed him to reflect deeply on his circumstances. It also led him to reflect on nature, because it provides a guide for what’s true. So he thought a lot about how things work, which helped to put himself, and his own circumstances, in perspective.

He saw that at the big band, all the laws and forces of the universe were created and propelled forward, interacting with each other as a perpetual motion machine, in which all the bits and pieces coalesce into machines, that work for a while, fall apart, and then coalesce into new machines. This goes on into eternity. Everything is a machine.

We individually are machines, made up of different machines. Our circulatory system, our nervous system, that produce our thoughts, our dreams, our emotions, and all the other aspects of our distinct characters.

All of these different machines evolve together through time to produce the realities we encounter every day.

All this may sound very philosophical, it is also very practical, because it shows you how you could deal with your own realities in a better way.

For example, Ray observed that everything happens over and over again in slightly different ways. Some in obvious short-term cycles that are easy to recognize, so we know how to deal with them, like the 24-hour day. Some so infrequently that they haven’t occurred in our lifetimes, and we’re shocked when they do, like the once in a 100 year storm. And some we know exist but are encountering for the first time, like the birth of our first child.

Most people mistakenly treat these situations as being unique, and deal with them without having proper perspective of principles to help them get through them. Ray found that if instead of dealing with these events as one-offs, he could see each as just another one of those, and approach them in the same way as a biologist might approach an animal. First identifying its species, then drawing on principles for dealing with it appropriately.

Because Ray was able to see these events transpire in pretty much the same ways over and over, he could more clearly see the cause-effect relationships that govern their behaviors, which allowed him to develop better principles that he could express in both words and algorithms.

He learned that while everyone expects the future to be a slightly modified version of the present, it is typically very different. That’s because people are biased by recent history, and overlook events that haven’t happened in a long time, perhaps not even in their lifetime. But they will happen again.

With that perspective, he realized that what he missed when he called for a great depression was hidden in the patterns of history, and he could use his newfound knowledge of these patterns to make better decisions in the future.

And when he thought about his challenge of balancing risk and reward, he realized that risk and reward naturally go together. So to get the most out of life, one has to take more risk, and that knowing how to appropriately balance risk and reward is essential to having the best life possible.

Imagine you were faced with the choice of having a safe, boring life if you stay where you are, or having a fabulous one if you take the risk of successfully crossing a dangerous jungle. That is essentially the choice we all face.

For Ray, the path forward was clear, but that doesn’t mean that the path forward was without challenges. He still had to face two big barriers that we all have to face.

# Your Two Biggest Barriers

Ray cannot tell you which path in life if best for you, because he doesn’t know how important it is for you to achieve big goals relative to how important it is for you to avoid the pains required to get them. This is the courage he spoke of earlier and we each have to feel these things our for ourselves.

After his big mistake in calling for a depression, he had come to one of life’s forks in the road, as we all do. If he had made the choice of taking a normal job and play it safe, he would have ended up with a very different life than the one he had. But as long as he could pay the rent, put food on the table, and educate his kids, the only choice for him was to risk crossing the jungle in pursuit of the best life possible.

His bet on there being a depression gave him a healthy fear of being wrong. In other words, it gave him deep humility, which is exactly what he needed. At the same time, it didn’t stop him from aggressively going after the things he wanted. To succeed, he needed to see more than he along could see. But standing in his way of doing that were the two biggest barriers everyone faces.

Our ego and blind spot barriers.

This barriers exist because of how our brains work.

The ego barrier is the parts of your brain that prevent your from acknowledging your weaknesses objectively so you can figure out how to deal with them. Your deepest seated needs and fears reside in areas of your brain that control your emotions and are not accessible to your higher-level conscious awareness. And because our need to be right can be more important than our need to find out what’s true, we like to believe our own opinions without properly stress-testing them. We especially don’t like to look at our mistakes and weaknesses. We are instinctively prone to react to explorations of them as though they’re attacks. We get angry, even though it would be more logical for us to be open to feedback from others. This leads to us making inferior decisions, learning less, and falling short of our potential.

Everyone has blind spots. The blind spot barrier is when a person believes that he or she can see everything. But it is a simple fact that no one alone can see a complete picture of reality. Naturally, people can’t appreciate what they can’t see, just as we all have different ranges for singing, hearing pitch, and seeing colors. We have different ranges for seeing and understanding things. For example, while some people are better at seeing the big picture, other excel at seeing details. Some are linear thinkers, and others are more lateral. While some are creative but not reliable, others are reliable but not creative, and so on. Because of how our brains are wired differently, everyone perceives the world around them differently. By doing what comes naturally to us, we fail to account for our weaknesses and we crash. Either we keep doing that or we change.

Aristotle defined tragedy as a terrible outcome arising from a person’s fatal flaw. A flaw, that had it been fixed, would have instead led to a wonderful outcome.

In Ray’s opinion, these two barriers are the main impediments that get in the way of good decision-making.

# Be Radically Open-Minded

Taking risks and occasionally being ruined wasn’t acceptable and neither was not taking risks and not having exceptional results. He needed an approach that would give him the exceptional upside without also giving him exceptional downside. When he discovered it, it turned out to be his Holy Grail. To get it, he needed to **replace the joy of being proven right with the joy of learning what’s true.**

This need promoted Ray to seek out the most thoughtful people he could find who disagreed with him. He didn’t care about their conclusions, he just wanted to see things through their eyes, and to have them see things through his eyes, so that together they could hash things out, to discover what is true.

In other words, what he wanted most from them was thoughtful disagreement. Going from seeing things through just his eyes, to seeing things through the eyes of thoughtful people was like going from seeing things in black and white to seeing them in color.

That is when he realized that the best way to go through the jungle of life is with insightful people who see things differently then himself.

Recall the five step process from earlier. Because we are wired so differently, not everyone can do all the five steps well. But you don’t have to do them all alone. You can get help from other who are good at what you’re not, who are wired to perceive things you can’t. All you need to do is let go of your attachment to having the right answers yourself, and use your fear of being wrong to become open-minded to these other views.

In this way, you could point out the risks and opportunities that you would individually miss. Ray found that taking this radically open-minded approach and believability-weighting people’s thinking significantly increased his probabilities of making the best decision possible. This allowed him to ascend to greater heights and greater challenges.

In the past, Ray would have always wanted to do what he, himself, thought was best. But now he sought out the strongest independent thinkers he could find. There is nothing better than to be on a shared mission with extraordinary people who can be radically truthful and radically transparent with each other.

This approach led Ray to create a company with the unique idea meritocracy, operating in a unique way, that produced unique successes. In an idea meritocracy, you get the best of everybody. Everyone thinks independently, then we work through our disagreements to get at what’s best. However, not every opinion is equally valuable. And you have to learn to distinguish between good ideas and bad ones to get the best decisions. In other words, they needed to believability-weight people’s thinking.

Right now, there are many wonderful opportunities and dangerous risks surrounding you that you don’t see. If you saw them free of the distortions produced by your ego and your blind spots, you would be able to deal with them more effectively. If you could acquire this ability, and with practice you can, you will radically improve your life.

# Struggle Well

So far we have heard how Ray learned to confront his own realities, his problems, his mistakes, and weaknesses. And how he surrounded himself with others who could do things better than he could.

This was the most effective he discovered for making great decisions. This is not the normal way of being, but through this approach, he became very successful. And being successful enabled him to meet extraordinarily successful people and see how they think. He discovered that their journeys were similar to his. You might not know it, but they all struggled, and they all had weaknesses, and that they all get around by working with people who see risks and opportunities that they would miss.

Over time, Ray learned that by nature that most people’s greatest strengths are also connected to their most significant weaknesses. And striving hard for big things is bound to lead you to painful falls. It’s just part of the process. Such setbacks will test you. They sort people.

Some think hard about what caused their setbacks, learn lessons, and continue progressing toward their goals, while others decide that this game is not for them, and get off the field.

Ray has come to realize that success is not a matter of attaining one’s goals. Ray found that when he reached each new higher level of success, he rarely remained satisfied.

The things we are striving for are just the bait. Struggling to get them forces us to evolve, and it is this struggle toward personal evolution with others that is the reward.

Ray no longer wanted to get across the jungle, but instead wanted to find greater and greater challenges to go after, surrounded by great people working together on a shared journey.

Eventually the success of the mission and the well-being of the people alongside Ray became more important than his own success. He also started to see beyond himself, and wanted others to be successful when he is no longer here. He realized that if he failed to do that, he will be a failure.

He struggles with this now. We all struggle with different things at different times, until we either choose to give up, or until we die and become part of the larger evolutionary story.

This is how all machines work, and are recycled through time. When a machine breaks down, its part go back into the system to become parts of new machines that also evolve through time.

Sometimes this makes us sad because we become very attached to our machines. But if you look at it from the higher level, it’s really beautiful to observe how the machine of evolution works.

Now you must decide for yourself how you will evolve. Forget about where these principles came from. Just assess whether or not they are useful to you, and evolve them to suit your own needs. As with all of life’s decisions, what you do with them is ultimately up to you. Ray’s only hope for you is that you have the courage to struggle and evolve well to make your life as great as it can be.
