[[Make Honesty Your Only Policy]]

> It's in keeping with Nature to show our friends affection and to celebrate their advancement, as if it were our very own. For if we don't do this, virtue, which is strengthened only by exercising our perceptions, will no longer endure in us.
> - Seneca, *Moral Letters*, 109.15
