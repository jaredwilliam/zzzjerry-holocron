[[Basement Finishing]]

First thing to do is get as much out of the basement as you can so you are not constantly moving it around. 

Identify all of the obstacles in the area you are finishing, figure out the "zones" you want to build, and then work to get those two to mesh together for your initial design plan. Obstacles can include:
- Electrical panel box
- Water valves
- Gas lines
- Pipes
- Sump pumps
- Water heater
- Support columns
- Furnace
- Stuff overhead (A/C)

Once you have an initial design, then you can make a "working" floor plan that includes your "wish list" of features in the finished basement. 

Drawing Your Plan
- Measure your your basement and draw it out on paper - start with the full size, excluding any obstacles (the entire rectangle). Then add in each obstacle. 
- Map out the items in your wish list
