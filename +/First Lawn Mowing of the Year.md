[[Yard Care]]

When you mow the yard for the first time for the year (and maybe the second and third time as well), use a bag on the mower to help pick up any small debris, dead leaves, sticks, etc. This way, when you start mulching the grass instead, it's "fresh". I don't have any references for this, it's just my idea as I thought more about taking care of the yard.
