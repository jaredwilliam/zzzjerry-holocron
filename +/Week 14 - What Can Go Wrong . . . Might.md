We call the people who dwell on what might go wrong "[[Pessimists]]." Some even think that bad thoughts attract bad events. The [[Stoics]] found this all to be nonsense. In fact, they had a practice of *[[Praemeditatio Malorum]]* (premeditation of evils) that specifically encourages musing on the so-called worst-case scenario. [[Marcus Aurelius]] would begin his day thinking about all the ugliness he would see on display at court - not for the purpose of working himself up, but precisely the opposite, to calm and focus himself to be prepared to act in the proper way rather than to react. [[Seneca]], too, practiced meditating in advance, not only about what normally happens, but what could happen. [[Epictetus]] went as far as to imagine losing a loved on every time he would kiss them. The [[Stoics]] believed all that we have is on loan from [[Fortune]], and that [[Negative Visualization Helps Increase Our Awareness of the Unexpected]] - don't shy away from this in your thoughts.
