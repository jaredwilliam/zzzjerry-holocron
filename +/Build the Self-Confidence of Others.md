[[Build Up, Don't Tear Down]]

Is there a worse environment to work in than one where bullying and one-upmanship is the norm? Sometimes leaders seem to think that that is part of the job description - that they are there to regulate and keep people in line. In truth, tearing people down is incredibly counterproductive. [[Pete Carrol]], coach of the [[Seattle Seahawks]], poses a question: If self-confidence is so important for players, why would a coach ever do anything to damage it? [[Marcus Aurelius]], who had the power to take down anyone at will, almost never did. Instead, he reminded himself that it was better to build up - be community-minded, modest, prepared, and tolerant of others. We are made for cooperation (*synergia*) and to render works help in common (*Praxeis Koinonikas Apodidonai*). Let's think about that going forward: How can we help build the self-confidence of others? How can we find some of our own in doing do?
