[[Panic is Self-Inflicted Harm]]

# Notes

> For even peace itself will supply more reason for worry. Not even safe circumstances will bring you confidence once your mind has been shocked - once it gets in the habit of blind panic, it can't provide for its own safety. For it doesn't really avoid danger it just runs away. Yet we are exposed to greater danger with our backs turned.
> - Seneca, *Moral Letters*, 104.10B
