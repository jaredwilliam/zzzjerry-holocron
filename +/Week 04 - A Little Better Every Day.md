#dailystoic

The [[Stoics]] saw their lives as works in progress. They didn't believe they were born perfect but they believed that with work, and dedication, they could [[Get a Little Better Every Day]]. There is a real delight in this progress, as [[Epictetus]] quoted by way of [[Socrates]]. [[Marcus Aurelius]] avidly pursued his own education and improvement, eagerly looking for advice from books, mentors, and historical examples. Follow that example this week, and see how you get a little better as each day passes. 

We must keep constant watch over ourselves and, as [[Seneca]] phrased it, put each day up for review. Looking back on our day helps us to better understand where we may have fallen short and gives us tangible feedback for how to improve and grow. [[Only What You Measure and Record Can Be Monitored]]; [[Only What You Put Up for Reflection Can Be Learned From]].
