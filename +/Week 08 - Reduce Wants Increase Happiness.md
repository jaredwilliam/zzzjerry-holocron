## Lesson
The [[Stoics]] knew that wanting less increases gratitude, just as wanting more obliterates it. [[Epictetus]] focused much of his teaching on helping his students reduce the destructive habit of wanting more. In it he saw the key to a happy life and relationships. By practicing the art of wanting less and being grateful for the portion that we already have before us, we are hopping off the so-called hedonic treadmill and taking a real step on the path to a life of real contentment.
