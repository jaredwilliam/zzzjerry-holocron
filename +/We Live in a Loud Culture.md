[[Practice Silence]]

# Notes
- We live in a loud culture and we try to keep up by being louder in return. How much trouble does that cause us? How much might we learn if we spent more time listening to other than we do trying to sandwich our opinions in at every turn? How much of what we say have we come to regret? The truly loud thing to say is nothing.
