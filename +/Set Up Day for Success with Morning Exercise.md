[[Fitness]]

Starting your day with exercise sets you up for a healthier and more successive mindset. 

Do some sort of movement first thing in the morning. It doesn't really matter if it's weight lifting, cardio, yoga, or just going for a walk. Try to spend the first 30 - 45 minutes of your day on yourself. Moving is the most important thing you can do. And life is going to get in the way during the day and you will come up with excuses. Then you'll be mad at yourself, and that's not healthy. Starting the day with movement will also set up the rest of the day for a more victories because you're going to feel good about yourself and be healthier, putting yourself into a better mindset and literally be better.  

I have found that a walk around in the neighborhood for 20+ minutes followed with a stretching session (e.g., [[Yin Yoga]]) and then 10 minutes of [[Breath Work]] and/or [[Meditation]] is a great way to start the day.
