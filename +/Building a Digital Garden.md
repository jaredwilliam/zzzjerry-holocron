A digital garden focuses more on stock over flow. 

## Stock Over Flow
> Flow is the feed. It's the posts and the tweets. It's the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist. Stock is the durable stuff. It's the content you produce that's as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It's what people discover via search. It's what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time. 

## A Space for Collecting the Dots
Creative research is all about collecting the dots. Normally we think of this as "connecting" the dots but you cannot connect the dots that you cannot see, and we only hold a tiny number of things in our brains at once. The Garden is a space to collect and organize the dots, which is a crucial foundation for thinking, creativity, and more.
