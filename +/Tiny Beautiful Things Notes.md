> She cast him as human: complicated, flawed, and capable of redemption. 

- This is how we should see other people. Instead of bad-mouthing them, realize that they are human and that you are no different. Had my mother done this with my biological father, maybe there could have been some redemption. But since she effectively demonized him, we grew up believing he was a demon. And maybe he was - I'm not saying she was wrong - but it prevented us from ever giving him a chance. 

___

> When I was just barely becoming a woman and my mother knew she was going to die, she stroked my hair and told my it was okay if I wanted to reach out to my father again, that I should always be open to the possibility of forgiveness and reconciliation and change, and that doing so was not a betrayal of her, but rather evidence of the woman she'd raise me to be. 

___

> We get the work done on the ground level. And the kindest thing I can do for you is to tell you to get your ass on the floor. I know it's hard to write, darling. But it's harder not to. The only way you'll find out if you "have it in you" is to get to work and see if you do. The only way to override your "limitations, insecurities, jealousies, and ineptitude" is to produce. You have limitations. You are in some ways inept. This is true of every writer, and it's especially true of writers who are twenty-six. You will feel insecure and jealous. How much power you give those feelings is entirely up to you. 

Get to work on whatever it is you want to work on and stay humble about it. The first time you do anything is going to be bad, so just get it out of the way. Only by producing and showing progress are you going to gain confidence in your own abilities. The feelings of insecurity and jealousy are inevitable. But being paralyzed by them in unacceptable. Understand that you are just experiencing those feelings in this moment, which will pass, and that you are not those feelings (i.e., you are not a jealous person, you happen to be experiencing jealousy). 

___

> To be genuine means to be actual, to be true, to be sincere and honest. 

This doesn't mean you need to be an asshole about it though. 

___

> But transformation often demands that we separate our emotional responses from our rational minds. 

It's ok to experience and have emotions, but when dealing with something troubling, it's better to think through it rationally. For example (from the book), your rational mind knows that men leave their wives for younger women all the time. Your emotional response is you cannot believe it when your own father does it. 

___

> There aren't three options. There is only one. As Rilke says, "You must change your life."

Sometimes when we are facing a difficult situation, we can come up with a number of options that we feel are the only choices that we have. Some are good or some or bad. But really, they all boil down to one choice - change your life. And to change your life, you have to change who you are. And to change who you are, you have to change what you do. 

___

> The only way out of a hole is to climb out. 

So stop digging. 

___

> Ask better questions, sweet pea. The fuck is you life. Answer it. 

When you're looking around at life, the world, the events happening in it, and all you can think of is "WTF" - that's life. But asking "WTF" isn't going to get you anywhere. Think through the problem.

___

> Do you know what boundaries are? The best, sanest people on the planet do. 

Make sure that you have established boundaries for yourself. Setting boundaries on people in your life is not a punishment on them or a judgement of them - it is allowing yourself to have some self-respect. For whatever reason, that person is a negative influence on your life, and all you are doing is removing the toxicity from your life. 

___

> Another thing that the best, sanest people on the planet do is they have the guts to tell the truth. 

This does not mean you have to be cruel. Tell a person that you love them and care for them and want them to be happy, but you will under no circumstances accept certain behavior. 

___

>Another thing that the best, sanest people on the planet know: that life is long, that people both change and remain the same, that every last on of us will need to fuck up and be forgiven, that we're all just walking and walking and walking and trying to find our way, that all roads lead eventually to the mountaintop. 

___

> One day at a time.

AA teaches alcoholics to use this phrase when they are in recovery. They say this because "I will never drink again" is too damn hard and it's bound to fail. 

___

> Acceptance has everything to do with simplicity, with sitting in the ordinary places, with bearing witness to the plain facts of our life, with not just starting at the essential, but ending up there. 

> Acceptance asks only that you embrace what's true. 

When something bad happens to us, we sometimes get angry about it, which is human and normal, but being angry means that there is a piece of you that isn't yet convinced it did. You're looking for the explanation, the loophole, the bright twist in the dark tale that reverses its course. 

___

> I'm not suggesting one deny negative emotions, but rather that you accept them and move through them by embracing the power we have to keep from wallowing in emotions that don't serve us well. 

___

> Who we become is born of who we most primitively are; that we both know and cannot possibly know what it is we've yet to make manifest in our lives. 

When everyone seems to be zipping by in life as if they were driving a Lamborghini, understand that it is okay to travel by foot. There is so much ahead that is worth seeing, so much behind you can't identify at top speed. You are going to be alright - not because you majored in one area or because you did or did not apply to law school - but because all right is almost always where we eventually land, even if we fuck up entirely along the way. 

___

> You don't have to get a job that makes others feel comfortable about what they perceive as your success. You don't have to explain what you plan to do with your life. You don't have to justify your education by demonstrating its financial rewards. You don't have to maintain an impeccable credit scores. Anyone who expects you to do any of those things has no sense of history or economics or science or the arts. You have to pay your own electric bill. You have to be kind. You have to give it all you got. You have to find people who love you truly and love them back with the same truth. But that's all. 

___

When someone asks you what you are going to with something you've acquired, for example, a particular degree, say:

> Carry it with me, as I do everything that matters. 

___

> Countless people have been devastated for reasons that cannot be explained or justified in spiritual terms. To do as you are going in asking *If there were a God, why would he let my little girl have to have possibly life-threatening surgery?* - understandable as that question is - creates a false hierarchy of the blessed and the damned. To use our individual good or bad luck as a litmus test to determine whether or not God exists constructs an illogical dichotomy that reduces our capacity for true compassion. It implies a pious quid pro quo that defies history, reality, ethics, and reason. **It fails to acknowledge that the other half of rising - the very half that makes rising necessary - is having first been nailed to the cross**.

___

> To do better you're going to have to try. 

___

> Go, because you want to. Because wanting to leave is enough. 

___

> Forgiveness doesn't mean you let the forgiven stomp all over you once again. Forgiveness means you've found a way forward that acknowledges harm done and hurt caused without letting either your anger or your pain rule your life or define your relationship with the one who did you wrong. 

___

> I know it's a kick in the pants to hear that the problem is you, but it's also fucking fantastic. You are, after all, the only person you can change. 

___

> You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself. I don't say this as a condemnation - I need regular reminders to stop feeling sorry for myself too. **I'm going to address you bluntly, but it's a directness that rises from my compassion for you, not my judgement of you**. Nobody's going to do your life for you. You have to do it yourself, whether you're rich or poor, out of money or raking it in, the beneficiary of ridiculous fortune or terrible injustice. And you have to do it no matter what is true. No matter what is hard. No matter what unjust, sad, sucky things have befallen you. Self-pity is a dead-end road. You make the choice to drive it down. It's up to you to decide to stay parked there or to turn around and drive out. 

___

> There is no why. You don't have a right to the cards you believe you should have been dealt. You have an obligation to play the hell out of the ones you're holding. And you and I both were granted a mighty generous hand. 

___

> I can't say when you'll get love or how you'll find it or even promise that you will. I can only say you are worthy of it and that it's never too much to ask for it and that it's note crazy to fear you'll never have it again, even though your fears are probably wrong. Love is our essential nutrient. Without it, life has little meaning. It's the best thing we have to give and the most valuable thing we receive. It's worthy of all the hullabaloo. 

___

> Fucked-up people will try to tell you otherwise, but boundaries have nothing to do with whether you love someone or not. They are not judgments, punishments, or betrayals. They are a purely peaceable thing: the basic principles you identify for yourself that define the behaviors that you will tolerate from others, as well as the responses you will have to those behaviors. Boundaries teach people how to treat you, and they teach you how to respect yourself. 

___

> Addiction is a tunnel that wakes you up in the middle of the night. Everything else happens out here in the light. 

___

> It's a truism of transformation that if we want things to be different we have to change ourselves. 

We have to take this to heart by making it not just a nice thing we say, but a hard thing we *do*. 

___

> Ultimatums have negative connotations for many because they're often used by bullies and abusers, who tend to be comfortable pushing their partners' back against a wall, demanding that he or she choose this or that, all or nothing. But when used by emotionally healthy people with good intentions, ultimatums offer a respectful and loving way through an impasse that will sooner or later destroy a relationship on its own anyway. 

For example...

> I won't live like this anymore. I won't carry our financial burdens beyond my desires or capabilities. I won't enable your inertia. I won't even though I love you. I won't because I love you. Because doing so is ruining us. 

___

> Every life "has a sister ship", one that follows "quite another route" than the one we ended up taking. We want it to be otherwise, but it cannot be: the people we might have been live a different, phantom life than the people we are. 

___

> I'll never know, and neither will you of the life you don't choose. We'll only know that whatever that sister life was, it was important and beautiful and not ours. It was the ghost ship that didn't carry us. There's nothing to do but salute it from the shore. 

___

> Sometimes the greatest truth isn't in the confession, but rather in the lesson learned. 

___

> You go on by doing the best you can. You go on by being generous. You go on by being true. You don on by offering comfort to others who can't go on. You go on by allowing the unbearable days to pass and allowing the pleasure in other days. You go on by finding a channel for your love and another for your rage. 

___

> But if you  really want to live happily ever after, if you honestly want to know what the secret to sustaining a lifelong "healthy love" is, it would be a good idea to openly grapple with some of the most common challenges of doing so, rather than pretending that you have the power to shut them down by making advance threats about walking out, "no conversation required", the moment a transgression occurs. 

___

> No, maintaining a relationship with your abusive father is not worth the pain, the self-doubt, and the depression. In cutting off ties with him, you have done the right thing. It's true that he is the only father you will ever have, but that does not give him the right to abuse you. The standard you should apply in deciding whether or not to have an active relationship with him is the same on you should apply to all the relationships in your life: you will not be mistreated or disrespected or manipulated. 

___

> I said you were strong and brave to stop communicating with your father because you did something many people can never do. You set a boundary. You decided that you will not be mistreated and you acted upon that decision. That choice was born of anger and hurt. The territory beyond it is born of healing and transformation and peace - at least it is if you'd like to have a smashingly beautiful life. 

___

Two questions to ask about the written work from yourself and your peers: *What happened in this story?* and *What is this story about?* 

> It isn't enough to have had an interesting or hilarious or tragic life. Art isn't anecdote. It's the consciousness we bring to bear on our lives. 

___

> If you are to succeed in fulfilling your meaning, everything that happens in your life must flow from this truth.

"Truth" being the purpose of your life. 

___

> But the reality is we often become our kindest, most ethical selves only by seeing what it feels like to be a selfish jackass first. 

___

> We have to get burned before we understand the power of fire. 

___

> We do not have the right to feel helpless. We must help ourselves. That after destiny has delivered what it delivers, we are responsible for our lives. 

___

> When it comes to our children, we do not have the luxury of despair. If we rise, they will rise with us every time, no matter how many time we've fallen before. 

___

> You are not a terrible person for wanting to break up with someone you love. You don't need a reason to leave. Wanting to leave is enough. Leaving doesn't mean you're incapable of real love or that you'll never love anyone else again. It doesn't mean you're morally bankrupt or psychologically demented or a nymphomaniac. It means you wish to change the terms of on particular relationship. That's all. Be brace enough to break your own heart. 

___

> You've awakened from the dream. You're called to do something that will begin the process of changing your life, even though you don't yet know what it is you must do. That's okay. You don't need to. The first item on your to-do list isn't to know. It's to *trust yourself wildly* (don't turn away from your feelings). The second thing on your to-do list is to *forgive yourself* (for feeling like you've wasted your life). And third is to *test yourself* (relinquish the things you believe have so far kept your safe or comfortable, at least for a time). 

___

> You say that you're done floating, but I encourage you to think of it another way and trust yourself to keep floating, except differently. Instead of letting the days pull you down the same old streams that make you feel vague and full of regret - the meaningless jobs, the endless social media scrolling, the too-many hours with friends and *Friends* - let yourself float down channels that are more likely to bring you to the places you want to go. Float down the channel of your curiosity, of your creativity, of your fears, of your ambitions, of your power, of your desires, of your dreams. 

___

> There was a difference between my father being dead to me and my father being dead. 

___

> Remember that the most powerful think you learned in the enormous effort it took to shut that door between you and your mother is that there is no door. The door is a metaphor we use so we can pretend there's something solid to crouch behind. But there isn't We are the solid. The door is you. It's built by our strength and our courage, our wisdom and our resolve, our suffering and our triumph. 

___

On how she approaches responding to those who write to her...

> What I can do - what I try to do in every one of my columns - is to write words that will help everyone who read them to see their situations more clearly by illuminating the darkest corners within us. 

___

> It's the work you do each day that matters. Even if it's work that seems invisible. Even if it's work that doesn't lead to the outcome you hoped for. Even if others attempt to undo your work. 

___

> But then another thought came to me - the truer one: What if feeling this way about my writing doesn't run counter to my ability to do my work? What if all those wretched feelings are actually part of what makes it possible for me to write? What if it's a strength rather than a weakness? What if despair is my companion rather than my adversary? What if the negative feelings that surround me as I write contribute to my ability to stay humble and hungry, to give it everything I have, to trust that I can only write well if it feels like writing has almost killed me?
