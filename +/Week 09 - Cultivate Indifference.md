#dailystoic

Some people spend their lives chasing good things: [[Health]], [[Wealth]], [[Pleasure]], [[Achievement]]. Others try to avoid the bad things with equal energy: [[Sickness]], [[Poverty]], [[Pain]]. These look like two drastically different approaches but in the end, they are the same. The [[Stoics]] continually reminded themselves that so many of the [[Things We Desire]] and avoid are [[Beyond Our Control]]. Instead of chasing impossibilities, the [[Stoics]] trained to be equally prepared and equally suited to [[Thrive]] in either condition. They trained to be [[Indifferent]]. This is a [[Great Power]] and the cultivation of this skill is a very [[Powerful Exercise]].

The good are [[Virtues]] and all that share in them; the bad are the [[Vices]] and all that indulge them; the indifferent lie in between virtue and vice include [[Wealth]], [[Health]], [[Life]], [[Death]], [[Pleasure]], and [[Pain]].

> My [[Reasoned Choice]] is as indifferent to the reasoned choice of my [[Neighbor]], as to his breath and body. However much we've been made for cooperation, the [[Ruling Reason]] in each of us is [[Master]] of its own affairs. If this weren't the case, the [[Evil]] in someone else could become my [[Harm]], and [[God]] didn't mean for someone else to [[Control]] my [[Misfortune]].
