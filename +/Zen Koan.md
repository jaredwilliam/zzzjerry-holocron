A kōan is a story, dialogue, question, or statement used in [[Zen Buddhism]] practices in different ways. The main goal of a kōan in practice in Zen is to achieve kenshō - seeing one's true nature. 

Some examples I found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/jjcblt/whats_a_koan_that_gave_you_insight/):

> A man approached a [[Buddhist]] temple, a monk found him and invited him for tea. The man would dwell on his past, "I must have gone wrong" he said. The man continuously babbles so the monk decides to pour the tea. The man suddenly stops talking when he sees the monk is pouring too much but then exclaims, "Can't you see the cup is full?!" To which the monk replies, "Just like this cup, you are full of your own opinions. How can I show you the way of Zen if you do not first empty your cup?"

> "What is the way?"
> "Ordinary mind is the way."
> "Then may I direct myself towards it or not?"
> "To seek it is to deviate from it."

> Never got nothing from no kōan that I didn't already got.
