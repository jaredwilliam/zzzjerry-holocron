- Our bodies operate within the circadian cycles in what is called ultradian cycles that last 90 minutes.
- So any time you are going to try and focus, or do some sort of bout of physical exercise, or learn a new skill, or even have a focused conversation, the ideal duration is about 90 minutes.
- Not exactly 90 minutes, but we can reliably say 90 minutes or less.
- It is possible to go for two, three hours but it is not in-line with biology.
- The first five to ten minutes of that 90 minute focus is a transition time, basically to warm up the focus.
- Sometimes our focus is going to flicker and we will get distracted. A big part of focusing is going back to focusing.
- Your brain uses most of the calories of your base metabolic rate, so after a bout of 90 minute focus (or even 45 minutes maybe), you are going to be exhausted. It is best to take at least a 10 minute break and as long as 30 minutes and go through a deliberate de-focus. Use that time to focus on menial tasks or things that donâ€™t really require a ton of your concentration.
- Allow yourself to mentally decompress and let your mental state be idle. This period of idling is essential to your ability to focus, much in the same way that rest between sets of resistance training is vital to focus and perform during actual sets.
