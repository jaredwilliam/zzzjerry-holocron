[[Practice Silence]]

# Notes

[[Cato]] practiced the kind of public speech capable of moving the masses, believing proper political philosophy takes care life any great city to maintain the warlike element. But he was never seen practicing in front of others, and no one ever heard him rehearse a speech. When he was told that people blamed him for his silence, he replied, "Better they not blame my life. I begin to speak only when I'm certain what I'll say isn't better left unsaid."
