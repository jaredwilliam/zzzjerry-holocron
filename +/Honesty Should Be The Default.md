[[Daily Stoic]] by [[Ryan Holiday]]

I opened up this book/journal to continue following it after a couple weeks of not doing so. The lesson for the week was to "make honesty your only policy". There was a passage that stood out:

> But [[Marcus Aurelius]] didn't like faux attempts at honesty. If you have to say "I'm going to be honest with you here," you're casually saying that honesty is the exception and not the rule. 

The has been stuck in my head since I read it. The idea is if you say that to someone, you are implying that in ordinary circumstances you would have lied to them, but you're making an exception for some reason. 

Being honest with someone, especially if they are a loved one or a friend, shouldn't require its announcement - it should be the default. It shouldn't need to be clarified if you are being honest or not. 

It's my thought that "I'm going to be honest with you" isn't so much about clarifying that you are going to be honest. I think it is more about sparing the recipient's feelings. When one says that phrase, the subtext is that what is about to be said is going to be hard to hear for the listener, because it's some sort of "truth bomb" that maybe they need to hear to get their life in order. But the speaker doesn't want to hurt the person's feelings, they want to help. Or rather, they don't want the listener to be mad at them for hurting their feelings, so the phrase is used as a "get out of jail free card" in a sense, i.e., "I'm going to be honest with you here, and I'm going to say some stuff that you need to hear to get your shit together, but I don't want you to be mad at me, as I'm just the messenger here, and at least I am being honest, which is a good thing, so I am a good person, so if you do get mad at me, that's your problem."

However, I also think that being honest in a tough conversation, where a person needs to hear something to get their life in order, and being kind about it, are not mutually exclusive. When a friend or loved one needs to hear something (the truth) to help them put their life in order, but the information has the potential to hurt them, and you are going to give that message to them, there are seemingly two paths. 

The first is the "I'm going to be honest with you here" path. Utter that phrase before you say something harsh and you seemingly get a free morality pass. It's rationalized that since you were honest, which is good, you shouldn't feel bad. This is the easy path. Your job as messenger is complete and there is no more you need to do. And even if you did hurt your friend's feelings, they likely won't tell you that you did, because you were just honest with them, and they don't want to seem like an ass for getting mad at you for doing so, even if you were harsh. 

The hard path is still delivering the same message while being kind about it. This requires effort though. Delivering a message to someone that is hard for them to hear and won't hurt their feelings requires effort. It needs to be thought through and worded carefully. You need to consider that person's feelings, who they are, where they are at in life, and how they would receive the message. Instead of messenger, you are not in the role of a friend. The point is to help this person, not hurt them more. 

I simple analogy for these two scenarios I thought of while typing this is helping a friend to climb a wall they are struggling with. It's too tall for them and they need a ladder. Well lucky for them, you happen to have a ladder. It's a wooden ladder and for some reason, there is a bunch of unnecessary nails sticking out of it. It functions, but it hurts to climb. Giving the friend this ladder is akin to the first scenario. The second scenario is taking your time to remove all the unnecessary nails before giving your friend the ladder that helps them over the wall without getting hurt further. 

So when you have a message for someone that might be difficult for them to hear, and you care for this person and you want to be kind, don't use the phrase "I'm going to be honest with you" as a scape goat. Instead, actually be kind. Give them the message without hurting them.
