## Notes
- The only thing more difficult than the emotional toil of pursuing true excellence is the emotional toil of not pursuing true excellence. 
- On the physical side, elite performers always try to get enough sleep and exercise and maintain proper hydration and nutrition. 
- Elite performers cultivate and align drivers such as curiosity, passion, and purpose. 
- Intrinsic motivation is much more effective than extrinsic motivation in every situation excluding those where our basic needs haven't been met. 
- The wrong motivation can easily produce the wrong behaviors. 
- Exercise is a nonnegotiable for peak performance. 
- Flow follows focus.
- The establishment of a goal is one of the easiest ways to increase motivation and enhance performance. 
- We need to know our needs - that is, our intrinsic motivations - before we can utilize goals as a way of fulfilling those needs. 
- Big goals work best when there is an alignment between an individuals values and the desired outcome of the goal. 
- A proper clear goal sits right inside your challenge - skill sweet spot, meaning it's hard enough to stretch you to the edge of your abilities, but not hard enough to push you beyond, into that demotivating realm of anxiety and overwhelm. 
- No pressure, no diamonds. 
- High performance is 90% mental. And most of that mental edge comes from being able to control your thoughts. 
- How to confront our fear. Two options:
	- Build up a tolerance through "systematic desensitization".
	- Go all in at once, "flooding". 
- Going in the direction that scares you most amplifies attention and this translates into flow. 
- Excellence, no matter what level, will always take everything we got. 
- Best recipe for increasing happiness:
	- A daily gratitude practice
	- A daily mindfulness practice
	- Regular exercise
	- A good night's rest
- Gratitude, mindfulness, exercise, and sleep are nonnegotiable for sustained peak performance. 
- Frustration is simply an obstruction to a goal that demands an innovative response. 
- For creativity, frustration is a sign of progress, a sign that much needed breakthrough is a lot closer than you suspect.
