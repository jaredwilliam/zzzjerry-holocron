Here's a [[Humbling]] thought: Even if your [[Life]] is amazing and successful, even if you mind your own business and are king to everyone you meet, *somebody*, *somewhere*, is going to be [[Happy]] when you're [[Dead]]. Somebody who wants to buy your house, somebody who you pissed off in high school, an up and comer looking to enter the job market, some hater who doesn't like your work - they're going to smile when they hear the news that you've passed. At the very least, there are some [[Worms]] who are going to be glad to get to work on your [[Corpse]]. 

It's true for you and it's true for everyone. It was as true for [[Gandhi]] and [[Mother Teresa]] as it is true for [[Anthony Bourdain]] and [[David Bowie]] and [[Kate Spade]] and the countless others who we say have left us too soon. [[Marcus Aurelius]] knew it would be true for himself, even though hw was one of history's few examples of a good king. As he wrote: *It doesn't matter how good a life you've led. There'll still be people standing around the bed who will welcome the sad event. Even with the intelligent and good.  Won't there be someone thinking, "Finally! To be through with that old schoolteacher. Even though he never said anything, you could always feel him judging you." And that's for a good man. How many traits do you have that would make a lot of people glad to be rid of you? Remember that, when the time comes.*

Really though, that's something to remember *now* - hopefully long before your time comes. Because it helps prevent [[Ego]] from creeping in. It prevents you from getting too caught up in trying to please everyone all the time. In a way, it's a relief to accept that not everyone is rooting for us, and that no matter how successful we are, we can't win over the whole world. 

Be true to who you are, Marcus said, be [[Kind]] and [[Caring]] to the [[People Who Matter to You]]. And don't be too attached to [[Life]] or your [[Reputation]], because, at the end of the day, we all get knocked down to the same level when we [[Die]]. Whether we're [[Alexander the Great]] or [[Mr. Rogers]] or a [[Mule Driver]], we get buried in the ground and chewed up by [[Bugs]] until there's nothing left. And some people are glad to hear of it.

It's a humbling thought.
