> Being unexpected adds to the weight of a disaster, and being a surprise has never failed to increase a person's pain. For that reason, nothing should ever be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent out in advance to all things we shouldn't just consider the normal course of things, but what could actually happen. For is there anything in life that [[Fortune]] won't knock off its high horse if it pleases her?
