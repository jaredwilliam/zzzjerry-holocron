To create your life vision, you’re essentially creating a description for the life you want to have, but make sure to answer these questions:
1. What will be the most fundamental, general, and guiding principles for your life?
	1. If you consistently fail to live up to your principles, then you’re failing to live for the life you want, the one you decided to pursue.
	2. Examples:
		1. Always do the right thing
		2. Take responsibility for your life and for every situation you find yourself in. Your response to anything is to do something about it, and if you can’t do anything about it or don’t want to do anything about it, then don’t complain about it.
2. What values will your life reflect?
	1. Place them roughly in order of importance.

For questions 4-11, you can be very general at first. Time brings clarity and you want to be open minded so that you don’t go down the wrong path. Also, curing cancer is a good goal, but if you’re not realistic, you’re in danger of spending your whole life working towards something and having it all amount to nothing. Ambition is important, since without it you might live a life that is not what you deeply desired, but you have to balance ambition with being realistic, which is not an easy problem to solve.

Your principles, values, ideal self, and your general life goals should all be consistent with each other. You can’t say you value frugality and then have a goal of owning a Ferrari. The more tightly connected your life vision is, the better it is.

Take some time to create your life vision. It’s going to be what your whole life is about after all. Set aside at least a couple of hours for deep thought, self-reflection, and imagination. Don’t expect your life vision to come our perfect the first time. You get to modify it later and improve it as you gain experience in life. You don’t want to be paralyzed by the task of creating a vision for your life that’s so perfect or that your so certain about such that you spend a good chunk of your life organizing your life, as if anyone should live a life that was all about organizing it and never actually living it.

Recognize that in the future you may change your life vision completely if you become more wise or have an enlightening experience.

The more important thing about your life vision is that you avoid going down the wrong path in life. This quote is something I always keep in mind:

“People may spend their wholes lives climbing the ladder of success only to find, once they reach the top, that the ladder is leaning against the wrong wall.”

If you spend your whole life trying to be rich and famous and better than everyone else, you might find yourself on your deathbed, completely unfulfilled, and you may have wished you spent more time making true friends and making a difference, and you may have a lot of regret. So make sure that you go after what truly matters in life. This requires deep thought and an accurate imagination. Answer the questions: What do you truly want from life and why? What will make you truly happy? What will truly be fulfilling and five you inner peace? What would you do if you could do anything, that is, without any supposed personal limitations and without following any scripts? If it helps, you could imagine that you are on your deathbed reflecting on your life, or that you are at your funeral and hearing what other people have to say about you. What sort of life seems exciting and fulfilling to you from the shows you have watched and the book you have read? What’s a similar way you can live your life? What sort of lives do the people you admire lead? What kind of life would an ideal significant other have? Shouldn’t you lead a similar life?

Studying philosophy can be useful for identifying what the good life may consist of.

Once you have your life vision, or at least a start of one, you can set some short-term goals. Your short-term goals should be directly aligned with your life vision, that is, your short-term goals should reflect the principles and values you set out to live for. Your short-term goals should help you become the person you want to become. Your short-term goals should put you in the direction of eventually accomplishing your life-goals and living the life that you want to live, as specified in your life vision.
