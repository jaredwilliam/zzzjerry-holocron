- Right before bed, after reading a story, ask them about one good thing from their day, and share with them one good thing from your day. 
	- If they are having a bad day or does something scary, make your good thing about how strong and brave they are. But phrase "brave" and "strong" in terms of effort: "I'm very happy to see how you've tried even if you were scared!" or "that was a tough thing to do, I'm very proud to see how you've done your best and accomplished it." 
	- Also, write down (or email) what they say to give it to them in the future. 
- Read to them every night for at least 15 minutes, no exceptions. 
- Let them pick the batter, frosting, toppings, and candles for their birthday cake and make it together. 
- Buy an ornament each year that represents something that happened that year and gift the ornament collection once they move out. 
- Try new things outside of what you would normally do. 
- New pajamas and a book on Christmas Eve.
