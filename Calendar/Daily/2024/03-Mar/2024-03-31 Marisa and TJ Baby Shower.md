[[Memory Book]]

Ellie and I went to [[Marisa Hewett]] and [[TJ Hewett]]'s baby shower at the [[Grand Pacific Hotel]] in [[Olmsted Falls]]. 

We got their baby, [[Poppy Hewett]] a [[Star Wars]] book. We also went on a [[Pack-and-Play]] and [[Diapers]] with [[Melis Uras]] and [[Colin Bilski]]. 

It was [[Harry Potter]] themed. 

Ellie and I both happened to notice that TJ seemed to show some caring and happy emotions. You could see on his face that him having a little girl was becoming a reality. I think he is going to be a good dad.
