[[Memory Book]]

[[Eleanore Koesel|Ellie]] and I went to [[Dinner]] with [[Amy McGrath|Amy]] and [[Cully McGrath|Cully]] at [[Luca West]]. We were supposed to go to [[Dinner]] and a [[Piano]] show by the [[Cleveland Keys]], but the plans fell through. 

[[Kirsten Wagner|Kirsten]] and [[Adam Wagner|Adam]]'s babysitter ended up getting the flu, so they cancelled. Then [[Natalie Messmer|Natalie]] and [[Alex Messmer|Alex]] decided to stay in instead. 

Food at the restaurant was decent but not worth the cost.
