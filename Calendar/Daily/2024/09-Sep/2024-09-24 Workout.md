# Workout - 2024-09-24

## Strength
- 4 sets, 3 minutes each set
	- 5x [[Back Squat]] at 80% 1RM
	- 3x fast [[Goblet Squat]] without full extension
		- The point is to learn to be fast and stay under tension the whole time

## WOD
14:00 minute AMRAP
- 7/7 [[Single Arm Kettlebell Front Rack Reverse Lunges]] @ 53/35
- 14 [[Toes to Bar]]
- 28 [[Double Unders]]

Goal: 4 - 6 rounds

## Notes
[movements:: Back Squat, Goblet Squat, Single Arm Kettlebell Front Rack Reverse Lunges, Toes to Bar, Double Unders]
[summary:: Back squat - 330x5 for 3 sets. Goblet squat - 53x3. Did not do last set because hamstrings and adductors got tight. WOD - 3 rounds + the lunges. Was tired today as I hadn't exercised in a couple weeks as [[Eleanore Koesel|Ellie]] and [[Jared Korba|I]] were on our [[Boston 2024]] trip and then I was sick for a few days. Still not 100% today.]
