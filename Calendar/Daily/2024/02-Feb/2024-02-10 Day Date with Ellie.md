[[Memory Book]]

[[Eleanore Koesel|Ellie]] and I went out for my birthday. We were going to try to go to [[Tabletop CLE]] to play a game and have a drink, but we were hungry so first stopped at [[Hansa Brewery]] for some food. Turns out, the chef was on vacation and the kitchen was closed for the week. So we each had a drink and headed over to [[Market Garden Brewery]]. It was surprisingly busy. We each felt that the service was a bit slow and ordering food there might be a hassle, even though we were sitting at the bar. So we decided to head over the [[Nano Brew Cle]] for food as we thought it would be less busy. Our thinking was correct and we managed to get more drinks and some food. By the time we left though, it was almost 5:30 pm and we had not fed [[Pixel]], plus we were quite buzzed. We knew if we went to Tabletop, we wouldn't be getting home until almost 8, which Pixel would not be happy with lol. So we decided to get an Uber home to watch a movie. We ended up watching [[Midsommar]] starring [[Florence Pugh]], which was a good but very weird movie. 

Even though our plan to go the Tabletop didn't come to fruition, it was fun going out and just being with Ellie. I love that even something as simple as going to go get a drink with her can be so heart warming and fun.
