[[Memory Book]]

I went up to [[Tartine Bistro]] to hang out with [[Sean Mulder]] and [[Dean Valore]] in the [[Tartine Bistro Keep Room|Keep Room]]. 

I took the hot sauces that [[Garret Korba|Garret]] got me for my birthday to show (since the bottles were glass grenades) and to taste. We all thought that they tasted better than expected! 

For dinner we had [[Shrimp Cocktail]], [[Oysters]], [[Foie Gras]], [[A5 Wagyu Steak]]. We also had break service and Dean ordered a [[Meat Pizza]] that he has custom made at the restaurant (which is a funny concept). 

Drinks included a couple of different [[Wine]]s including [[Chateau Gloria Saint-Julien 2018]] and [[Warres Otima 10 Tawny Porto]]. 

For [[Dessert]] we had this [[Chocolate Mousse with Caramel]] topping on it. I believe it has a specific name but I cannot remember what it's called. Mine had a [[Birthday ]] candle put into it.
