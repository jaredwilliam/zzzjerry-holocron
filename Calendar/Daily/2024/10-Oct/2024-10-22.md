## Notes
- HOA Data Deep Dive
	- Predictability model
	- How much does each 'characteristic' influence the file scores?
	- How are variables interacting with each other?
- When following up with CL and NRZ, would they be able to respond by November 8th, or is it easier to set up a meeting in early November?
