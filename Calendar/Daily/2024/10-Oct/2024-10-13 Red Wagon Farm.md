## Notes & Photos
The 7 of us went to Red Wagon Farms in Columbia Station. We took the hay ride which was simple but the organizers took the time to set up goofy decorations on the trail. 

The guys also did the "All You Can Carry" pumpkin contest. Colin managed 4, TJ and myself got 5. It was harder than you would image because you are not allowed to have anyone help you load up pumpkins into your arms and you are not allowed to hold them by the stems.
