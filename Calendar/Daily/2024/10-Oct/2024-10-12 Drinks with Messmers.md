## Notes & Photos
Natalie and Alex were on their "big date" day where they leave the kids with someone for the night, go get massages, stay at a nice hotel, etc. They asked if we would like to meet them at [[Tartine Bistro]] which we were of course happy to, especially since the new fall menu was out. 

I had two interesting drinks. One was "Sleepy Hollow" with reserva rum, cinnamon, honey, apple cider, orange bitters, and a salted caramel rim. It was extremely smooth and tasted like a sweet apple cider with caramel. The other was "Baby Yaga" which is bourbon, cocoa, demerara, and bitters. It tasted like a boozey chocolate milk. 

This is the Baby Yaga.
