Ellie and I went out Saturday night. First we started with getting dinner and drinks at [[Southern Tier Brewery]]. Then headed over to [[Playhouse Square]] to see [[Brett Goldstein]] who stars as [[Roy Kent]] in the [[Ted Lasso]] show on [[Apple TV]]. We both thought that his performance was quite good - better than expected. It wasn't the best stand up we have seen, but it was better than we had expected.

After the show, as we were trying to get home, Uber was a bit expensive because there was a [[Cleveland Guardians]] game that night as well. So we got some [[Bird Scooters]] and rode them to [[Ohio City]]. Those scooters are a blast and I am tempted to buy my own.
