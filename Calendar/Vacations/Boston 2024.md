## Anniversary Trip to Boston
Dates: 2024-09-12 to 2024-09-16

## Overview
[[Eleanore Koesel|Ellie]] and [[Jared Korba|I]] went to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] for our first anniversary. We chose this destination because her aunt and uncle, [[Rhonda Ruby]] and [[Rich Herstek]] live north of Boston in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]]. Also, Ellie has never been to Boston while I have once and really enjoy the city. I was most excited about living the routine of every day life and spending some quality time with Ellie to celebrate one year of marriage. 

## Day 1: 2024-09-12
- Drove to Rich and Rhonda's
- Had appetizers and drinks on their back deck/porch which has a great view of the pond and forest behind their home. 
- Dinner was steak, potatoes, and maple carrots.
- We mostly sat around and chatted with them.
